These features include `Cell.size`, `Cell.shape`, `Marg.adhesion`, `Epith.c.size`, `Bl.cromatin`, `Normal.nucleoli`, `Mitoses`, and `Age`. In contrast, features such as `Cl.thickness` and `Bare.nuclei` have confidence intervals entirely above zero, suggesting they are strong predictors of the outcome and should be retained. Removing the non-significant features could simplify the model without substantially affecting its performance while improving its interpretability."
