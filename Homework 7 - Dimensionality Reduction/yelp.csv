0,"Maintenance here is ridiculous. My bathroom sink would leak like crazy after the warm water ran for a minute. They told me it was fixed, I'd come home turn the water on and by the time I was done taking my shoes off my bathroom was flooded. My kitchen sink started to leak so they replaced it and now I have next to no water pressure. \n\nThe appearance of this place is getting worse and worse. One example, our pool has been green all summer. \n\nRecently, I signed another lease and my rent for a one bedroom went up over $100 a month. That is disgusting to treat a tenant that way. As if they already aren't making a ton of money already, I got charged $50 because my rent wasn't paid on the 1st that was a holiday! I log on to my account on the 2nd to pay, thinking there wouldn't be a problem since the 1st was a holiday. Nope! $50! No grace period, not willing to work with me. I've never been late, ever! And it was the day after a holiday! I don't understand how they can be so unwilling to see the facts and help me out. \n\nI would never recommend this place to anyone."
1,"I really enjoy smaller more intimate Elite events such as this one because I really get a chance to truly talk, mingle and meet new people. There was ample seating for all, although our reserved Bar Section was packed it didn't feel crowded. Upon arrival everyone was given two coins to try the new Bar drinks; I had the Sauza Gold Coast Rita and the Aussie Rum Punch, YUM! Both drinks were excellent but the Rita edge out the Punch by a slight hair. The main focus of the event was to try the new appetizers which most can be purchased at about $4 once the new menu rolls out. I must admit I wasn't particularly blown away by any of the appetizers they were all just \""okay\"". My favorite of the appetizers were the Coconut Shrimp, they were perfectly fried yet still were moist and had that distinct shrimp flavor which is normally zapped out in the frying process. The most disappointing appetizer of the night were the flatbreads, although the toppings were good the flatbread itself fell short to me, it reminded me more of a cracker than an actual bread. Luckily, the drinks alone are worth coming back for Happy Hour. Once again another successful Elite Event is in the books! Great job Lindsey and a big thank you to the Outback Steakhouse management and staff!"
1,"Looking at their menu, I was a little skeptical about how good their burgers would be, but I was glad that everything went better than expected.\n\nI got the Button Buster and my dinning partner got the Kobe Beef burger.  We requested it medium and medium rare, respectively, and they came out right on point.  Nicely done, brgr.  The best thing about these burgers were the buns.  They did not come out soggy (looks like someone rested their meat before plating!  Yes!), which is a huge bonus in my book.  Soggy buns are disgusting.  Their buns also withstood the manhandling they had to endure while being devoured.  Another huge bonus for not falling apart.\n\nThe shoestring fries weren't the best fries I've ever had, but they were plenty better than school cafeteria fries.  :p\n\nWe also got the daily special milkshake which was vanilla peanut butter.  It was amazing!  Probably one of the better milkshakes I've had in my time."
1,Best sandwiches in Las Vegas! Awesome choices and completely customizable. Don't forget an order of fresh cut potato chips or fries seasoned to your liking. Top it off with a perfect dill pickle... Heaven!
0,"Was upset because they didnt have the Van i reserved, and they offered to give me and SUV- all they had. The SUV was absolutely filthy w food on the floor, n the carpet appeared stained w dark matter and looked disgusting. Had to take it home and clean it myself....however, The outside of the vehicle was washed. When i told the Enterprise clerk about the filthy interior she said they dont detail the interior...use a vacuum/some carpet cleaner!...jeez!! On the positive, the staff was friendly and did discount my rental, and on the return gave me another discount because the seat was broken on the SUV n wouldnt go down. Discounts helped but the gas milage on the SUV killed my pocketbook.  Lesson learned is dont pickup a vehicle at the end of the day...i got stuck w something i didnt want and there was nothing i could do about it, as i was leaving for a trip early in the morning.  Dont think i will rent from this location again."
0,"I can't agree with the other ladies who have posted their experiences.  It's been awhile but the last time I did business with these guys I knew I would never go back.  I took my car in to have the wheels balanced after I had purchased a set of brand new wheels and tires from the internet.  When I mounted the new wheels I was getting a vibration at freeway speeds so I decided to take it to Tire Pros to have the wheels balanced.  They charged me a resonable price since I did not purchase the wheels from them.  When I got home I did a quick walk around the car and that's when I noticed one of my wheels had a piece of metal chipped off right at one of the holes for the lug nuts. I know it wasn't there before because they were brand new.  I called Tire Pros back and told them what I found.  They said to bring it back, which I did.  When I got there the manager said he asked the tech about it and he said the damage was already there!  The manager then said there was nothing they could do about it.  =/  Nothing I dislike more than a dishonest business.  If they admitted to it I would probably be able to forgive and forget but I just want others to know that they aren't the \""Pros\"" their name claims to be."
0,"Okay, here it goes...this may get long winded but I swear it is a truthful and honest review, so please read closely\n\nI lived at Lakeside (formerly known as Lakeside Village) for over 3 years, through 2013 and I saw the old management company Con AM get bought out by another management company called Madrona Ridge. Con Am wasn't the best, but things went downhill when madrona ridge took over.\n\nWhen I first moved here they were literally giving apartments away, they were offering less than $500 per month for a 1 bedroom in a nice part of town, with a lake view, so it was a good deal. For the first 2 years there it was pretty solid, the managers knew my name, they cared about my problems and fixed anything I needed immediately, I'm talking same day service. They were nice people. Con AM and the old managers were nice to me and actually tried to show customer service...unlike the new management.\n\nAround the time Madrona Ridge took over things just got ratty. Loud and creepy people started moving in, bringing all of their loud and creepy friends with them. Supposedly they have a no crime policy and won't rent to criminals, yet the very loud and vocal neighbors loved to talk about their DUI's and jail time. A lot more weirdo people started showing up and walking around at night. I saw a drunk guy smash someone's windshield in a fit of rage and sped off, and someone did a nice hit and run on my car while it was parked...and of course nobody picked up their dog poop...at all. The landscapers didn't care to pick it up, the maintenance guys didn't care, so there it sat.\nMadrona Ridge promised all previous residents even better service than Con Am gave. I was wrapping up a lease when Madrona Ridge took over and they offered me an okay deal, so I stayed. But right after they started to get sloppy and dissapoint. They hired the current girls who manage Lakeside a few months later and their awful service started to show. \n\nThe current staff working here are probably the slowest, rudest, most impersonal women around. These girls Traci and Lucinda are NOT right for this job. They are NOT friendly or easy to deal with at all when you have a question or concern, they are NOT accommodating or welcoming, no smiles, just a bland \""I don't care\"" attitude. If you do anything to displease them or make them think hard they will treat you like dirt. They also won't bother remembering your name or showing you any kind of human service, they'll just call you \""HEY\"" or \""You.\"" Also, if you have a problem or a concern be sure to just walk in and demand to talk because they don't listen to their voicemails or return phone calls. \n\n I've had problems with bugs, repairs, questions, and rarely did they return a call or get anything moving unless you tell them again and again. In the early days when I needed something fixed con-am would have it fixed in a day or two, these girls will make sure it takes over a week if you're lucky. So either get good at fixing your own stuff or be prepared to wait, because as these managers know you aren't that important. Seriously...how hard is it to FAKE customer service? At least try to remember someone's name and care a little bit, a fake smile, anything helps, especially in a SALES position...you kill more flies with honey than vinegar. FYI.\n\nI left when they offered a renewal notice at the end of my lease, they offered me a new lease agreement that was ABSURD and overpriced. The one bedrooms here are 600 square feet, just tiny little run down apartments from the 1980's, and they are now asking $725.00+ per month...that doesn't include taxes, pet rent (if you have em) and utilities. So basically they are charging around $800 per month for a 600 sq. foot hole in the wall in an old crumby complex, when you can go find a nice, NEW, cleaner mark taylor or other luxury apartment for only a few dollars more per month. Uhhh yeah, no thanks lakeside! I did just that and found a better, nicer, newer place for only pennies more than here. \n\n Do not believe the website, it is totally false advertised. What you see online is NOT what you will get in person. What you'll really see are outdated appliances from the 80's, peeling paint, popcorn ceilings, cheap carpeting, tiny closets, and no storage space. \n\nLakeside used to be a lot better, I used to love it at first and I'm grateful for the good times I had while it lasted. The management used to be nicer, the grounds used to be cleaner, and the prices used to be reasonable. This place has delusions of grandeur...the managers think it's a luxury complex and are charging people ridiculous luxury prices for run down, ugly little apartments that are not worth their price tag, and the service you get isn't worth a dollar. \n\nThe area is pretty good and the lake is pretty at night time, there are nice walkways and some handy shops nearby, but honestly look elsewhere if you want both quality and value."
0,"The whole dog theme for a restaurant is bizarre! Peanuts in a dog bowl, dog bone shaped tables, dog related stuff on the walls, but what really killed it for me were the pictures of dogs on the menu. I love dogs, but I don't want to be looking at them  when I'm browsing my menu. The first thing that pops into my head is dog hair, \ndog breathe, and poop....eew!\n\nThe servers are SLOW, don't know the menu and specials, and are not the friendliest. The menu is all over the map. My impression was that this is an \""American Grill\"", but you can order burgers, sliders, Mexican, pasta, and even pizza too....WTH? The only positive thing I have to say about this place is that they have a cool patio with nice fire pits. So unless you're just looking to have a drink and hang out by the fire, stay away from this place.\n\nI used to frequent the Chuy's that was at this location, and that was fun and yummy! If you want dogs and want to be playful, take it to the dog park, not the restaurant."
0,"I have conflicted feelings about Palazzo's and you will soon see why.  Walking in on a Wed night solo, I was greeted by a very warm (albeit empty) old-school Italian restaurant.  I sat and the beautiful marble bar and immediately the cordial bartender Larry, was at my beck and call.  I ordered a Beefeater Gibson martini up, and he seemed very happy to make one; not too many Gibsons are made these days.\n\nHe was very pleasant and made an excellent drink.  Since the place was pretty empty, the manager was also in the bar chatting about Pittsburgh, sports, politics, and also was very friendly.  I went with my order: started with the escarole with beans, followed by a stand-by spaghetti & meatballs.\n\nThe escarole portion was large and almost like a stew; nicely cooked leaves of escarole mixed with a spicy tomato sauce and a good amount of cannellini beans.  It was excellent, satisfying and could well stand as a meal on its own.  I then proceeded to have the worst pasta I've ever had in a restaurant.  The spaghetti tasted and looked like it came from Chef Boyardee.  The sauce was flavorless and bland.  The noodles were cooked light years beyond al dente and were mushy, starchy and awful.  The meatballs were decent, but the pasta was so bad filet mignon couldn't have saved them.\n\nI really want to give Palazzo's another shot since the service, staff, ambience and escarole were fantastic.  But to screw up such a simple and classic dish I am worried about how some of the more complicated items will come out."
1,"Ok so before I came to this place the only other ramen I had eaten was the classic meal of cheap college students, so keep in mind I am in no way an expert on authentic ramen. That said, this place is delicious!! I've had the tonkatsu ramen both times and each time it was great, tried the egg addition once and the extra green onions. I would get the green onions again, the egg was a little much for me. Either way the broth has an amazing smooth creamy like texture for a pork broth, the noodles are cooked perfectly, the service is timely and very polite, and they have some amazing iced oolong tea. I can't wait for it to get cooler out so I can come here even more often."
0,I avoid this place!  They play extrememly loud music on Saturday nights till 2am. I will not go there until they change their practices.
0,"the food is ok but I'm taking a star away because they don't have a croque madame for brunch.  unheard of for a \""French bistro\"".  I had the bistro burger with frites.  cooked nicely with high quality meat.  the bun could have been a little fresher but overall a decent meal.  dessert sucked.  we shared a \""key-lime cheesecake\"". between 3 of us, 75% of it was left on the plate.  it was a plain cheesecake (and not close to fresh).  the \""key-lime\"" aspect was a neon green jelly like substance squirted on top and around the cheesecake. hidioso."
1,"I was gonna make this place my first 5 star, but I don't give 5 stars, so decided to keep in tradition.\n\nThis place was such a fantastic find. We are a huge fan of BYOW places, because it allows you to focus more on the food/experience rather than counting ridiculous wine bottle prices. So I had this place bookmarked for a while.\n\nWe decided to try it out, and it was unique and really great. \n\nAs soon as we walked in, about 8pm, with two wine bottles, we found the owner playing violin for and joking with a table in the middle of the place. We walked in and he stopped and said, \""Ahhh! You must be hungry too! Sit!\"" It was funny and welcoming and warm. We then sat and opened the wine and he came and explained the menu, which features about 5 main courses, and other things like soups/salads etc. All the stuff is home made food. NOTE: This is a small place by a guy and his wife, and they make the menu every night. \n\nUsually, that's not exactly my thing, either because of a stand off-ish vibe, or something. But this place really had a lovely aura. We though we were in an Eastern European town for a couple of hours.\n\nMenu features mostly meat items, but there are vegetarian options, as my wife is vegetarian. We had two vegetable soups, I had stuffed cabbage (lamb and shredded cabbage with garnishes and sauce) and my wife had a mushroom dish (portobello mushrooms cooked in sauce and served with potatos). We shared a salad, and then we had a crepe desert to share also.\n\nIt was an amazingly excellent meal. I swear to God one of the best food meals I have ever had anywhere. My plate was HUGE, and I eventually ate it all, slowly. Even though the vibe was different, the place was so chill, so friendly, and the food was amazing. We sat and talked and drank wine over the course of two hours and had a great time. And at the end, for two people, the bill was $35! It was really great.\n\nWe then walked out, feeling super energized and good. And walked down duluth street to the park. It was a really great evening, and we were surprised.\n\nWe're totally sold now, and will 100% revisit several times. It's a great unique experience. Go there. Do not expect a situation though where you can be rude to the owners and treat them like they work for you. Diners with that approach might be met unkindly, which one of the reviews below suggests to me could be the case.\n\nThree other tables came in while we were there, and everyone of us was loving it. Great place."
0,"I would avoid. The food is OK, the prices are ludicrous, the portions are tiny. This is small portions of average food at fine dining prices."
0,"For years I've listened to co-workers tell me how great this place is. The Yelp reviews spoke well for the place too. Where this comes from I'll never know.\n\nThis weekend we went to Pedro's for the first time and I was super excited. I love Mexican food, Americanized or not. I was extremely disappointed in this place.\n\nChips and salsa are a staple of any Mexican restaurant and they've got them here. Good sign I thought. I put some on a chip and crunched it in my mouth and was immediately disappointed. I don't know what the deal was with it but it was not good. My wife thought canned, I disagreed but whatever it was, it was sweet. Sweet salsa is no good in my book.\n\nI was skeptical at this point and we got our menus and looked them over while trying to modify the salsa to our liking. I think their food is a little pricey compared to a lot of places in town which made me even more skeptical. The waitress came and I ordered a standard staple which they called \""the business man's plate\"" consisting of rice, beans, an enchilada and a taco.\n\nThe food comes and my skepticism grows even further as my entire plate is covered in shredded cheese. Listen, I'm a semi-fat guy and I love cheese as much as anyone else but when you're using that much cheese you're trying to mask something. I look at the taco and it looks like a pre-made taco shell, like something you'd get at the grocery store but maybe a little more light and thin. I was surprised to find the taco shell wasn't too bad and the beef inside was pretty good as well. The enchilada on the other hand was crappy at best. The sauce? Not so good and the tortilla seemed undercooked. It just wasn't right. I didn't really try the beans as that's not my thing but my wife said they were sweet like the salsa. I should note the chips even seemed kind of sweet but that may have been the salsa too. The rice was the saving grace of the meal, I did indeed enjoy the rice but that's it.\n\nWhen we left I called my mother in-law to see if she'd ever eaten there and she said she thought it all gross as everything was sweet. I was happy to hear this as it confirmed I wasn't the only one who thought so.\n\nIf I were ever in the area (not often) and jonesing for rice (pretty sure that's never happened in my life) I might consider stopping in for a pint of it to go. Otherwise I'm more than happy to never set foot in this place again.\n\nHow this place has a 4 star average and so many awards hanging on their wall is beyond me.\n\nDon't believe the hype.\n\npros:\n\n- rice\n\ncons:\n\n- overpriced\n- bad salsa\n- mediocre food\n- sweet beans (?)"
0,The worst experience at subway. The moment i walked in jennifer was brooming the floor with no acknowledgement of the customer and max was helping another customer 10 min of waiting and she is still cleaning until her co worker told her if she can help the customer. She doesn't even say hi and absolutes terrible customer service. At least the other guy ( max ) was nicer and well mannered but this girl is telling stories to the other guy and keeps forgetting my order and makes faces and funny noises explaining her stories which was just unprofessional. \nJust disappointing.
1,"If you want a Parisian Vegas restaurant experience, then skip the buffet and eat at the Le Cafe.\n\nSince they had a special for $39, I couldn't resist and my friend Ian will kill me for not telling him I ate here. I ordered red wine, French onion soup, filet mignon medium rare with a side of baked potato and sauted mushrooms and for dessert chocolate layer cake. \n\nROOM CHARGE!\n\nFirst I had the bread basket with the warm butter and that was delicious and was a good pre-starter before the appetizer. My French Onion soup was good but I had better and my entree was very tender juicy and the two sides was a great addition to the entree.\n\nLastly the dessert (chocolate mouse layer cake) was very rich indeed with the berry and cranberry on the side of the dish. Yum mee!!\n\n\nThe service here is so far excellent and the staff here are very friendly.\n\nI'll be back to try other stuff on the menu if I'm ever near by."
0,"I hope that I'll have to edit this review one day...\n\nI walked into Ulta a few nights ago.  Honestly, I looked like a hot mess - straight from the gym, no makeup.  Not nice.  I'm new to makeup too - the YouTube \""how to eyeliner\"" kind of girl.  Ulta can be an intimidating place...\n\nAnyway, walk into Ulta.  Girl at the registers says hello.  I wander all over the store looking for that Naked eye shadow, you know which one... Super pretty, I think it's just under $20.  Searching for that, know what I want, just not where to find it.  There are associates EVERYWHERE, but none of them paying attention to me.  Two associates helping someone else.  One walks by me (while I'm browsing clearance) but doesn't say anything.  I wander around some more, obviously looking for something - and no one offers to help or even check on me.  ...ULTA, I JUST WANT YOU TO HELP ME SPEND MY MONEY.\n\nI finally found the Naked eyeshadow.  The color I want is out if stock.  No sales associates to be found.  I left.  No one said \""goodbye\"", \""thanks for coming\"", etc.  Maybe they'll be getting it in soon.  I wouldn't know.  C'mon Ulta - I wanted to spend money!"
0,"Came on a Thursday at 10am for a late breakfast with my husband and 3 kids. It wasn't very busy at all, but took an hour to get our food. Our kids were restless and antsy and it made for a frustrating wait. It was our first visit, we've been wanting to try for some time. I got the steak and eggs. The steak was cooked as desired and had decent flavor. The country potatoes were terrible, however, hardly cooked, almost raw mixed with hardly any peppers and onions. They offered it with fruit or biscuits, but had to pay an addt'l $1.75 for gravy. LAME! Who orders biscuits without gravy? At any rate, the small and meager amount of gravy I did receive was decent, nothing great. All in all, our bill was over $50, for a blah breakfast. We probably won't return due to service and just nothing to write home about food."
0,"Punch me in the throat why don't you?\nTwist the knife before you pull it out of my back!\nThis is a update of my review posted on July 6th for a questionable vist we experienced on the 4th of July.\nI recived a reply from someone claiming to be the business owner, saying she was sorry and to contact her if I had any questions. Must of been bogus! We tried to contact her a couple of times with no success. They must be busy planning there next scam. If you have 100 seats, sell a 100 tickets not a 120 hoping some won't show. You made your money, beyond that is greed.\nOnce bitten, twice shy."
0,"Heard mostly good things about Lenscrafters, nothing overwhelming. So decided to give them a try. New store opened at San Tan mall so it was close and convenient. \n\nThe eye exam was fine, really like the Optometrist. The customer service on the store side, however, was not so great. They were courteous enough when we were choosing glasses.  However when we were checking out the computer wasn't accepting the information that was being put in.  The woman helping us said she didn't care if it took 20 minutes, she wasn't asking for help to get in their system. \n\nWe were hoping it didn't take 20 minutes. Eventually she figured it out.\n\nThe next thing that put us off was several days later, when we went back in briefly to have my glasses re-adjusted (they were a little tight). An employee took them, then said plainly, \""just want you to know that if I break them, we're not responsible.\""\n\nUm, what? \n\nSo, no, not the best of experiences for me and my husband. We won't go back, nor would we recommend them."
1,"The lunch buffet is great for a group or just a couple.  The food is wonderful and consistent.  If you always wanted to try Indian food but are afraid you'll order something and not like it, fear no more!  The buffet is a wonderful way to try a myriad of representatives of this fine international cuisine.  This is a favorite of my family and my coworkers (and I work with a large number of Indian citizens!)"
1,this saturday morning affair puts (unfortunately) any chicago's farmer market to S-H-A-M-E.
1,"Wow! From the fried chicken, to the sides everything is homemade deliciousness, those corn meal flap jacks are awesome and don't leave with out some banana pudding.  We'll be back for sure."
0,"I wanted to love this place. I really, really did but really, really didn't love it. I didn't even like it that much. We took some friends there for lunch today and by the looks of the food, it seemed so promising. It is a casual spot where the food it pretty much pre-prepared and being heated in the windows at the counter. This restaurant has pizza, salads, pasta, sandwiches, and baked goods. I ordered one of the specials, chicken parmesan with a side of penne alla vodka. The chicken was so bland that I felt like I was eating boiled chicken. As my husband put it, it tasted like diet food but without the benefits of diet food because of the breading. The pasta was also weirdly bland and spicy. The spicy part really surprised me because I have never had it spicy. My husband had the penne alla campagna (1/2) and another (1/2) penne dish that we can't remember. His were slightly better than mine but not by much. It is sad that the best part of the meal was the pepperoni pizza we bought for kids. Would I go there again? Probably not. For 4 adults and 2 kids, we spent $65 which I find disappointing for an extremely mediocre meal. I suppose for people that work close by (it is downtown at Central and Adams), it is a nice convenience but if I wanted Italian food, I'd probably choose Pasta Bar."
1,"Came here on a Saturday night at around 11:30 pm with small group of 4. Fortunately, my friend got us on the guest list so we got to wait in the shorter line on the right side of the entrance. There was a cover of $10 for guys and ladies were free I believe.\n\nThere is a dress code. So for guys, I would say a MINIMUM is a nice pair of jeans, non-tennis shoes, and collared shirt. I did see some guys suited up, so if that's your style you won't be too left out. Most of the ladies I saw inside were dressed pretty well with short, sexy dresses and heels. \n\nOnce we got inside, it was pretty packed. Still got a drink (a bit overpriced) in a reasonable amount of time though. The DJ was really good and played a mix of EDM and R&B/Hip Hop. I appreciated it. I can only fist pump for so long. \n\nThe bathroom is clean and unisex. I was really confused at first when I walked in, but quickly figured it out. The men's urinals is behind a wall so you aren't in full view of the women's side (fortunately or unfortunately? Up to you I guess.) \n\nThe outside patio seemed nice, but once I stepped out, I got hit by a wave of smoke from everybody smoking cigarettes and quickly walked back inside. \n\nLeft around 1 am, and the place was still pretty packed and lots of people were dancing. \n\nOverall, with the decor, ambiance, crowd, and music, it reminded me of one of the nicer clubs I would see in Vegas or LA. Would go here again. Like other reviewers said though, get your name on some kind of guest list though. The general admissions line is just way too long."
0,"This hotel smells awful.  It's a mixture of cigarette smoke and coconuts.  It's overwhelming.  It gets on your clothes and on your skin.  I had a reservation for 4 nights, but I moved out after spending just 1 night.  I had to wash all my clothes."
1,"Le Saint Bock has over 19 drafts on their white chalk board... what to drink?? \n\nI can't think properly when I am too excited, faced with too many choices: local Quebec beers from various microbreweries. \n\nI ended up just ordering by numbers... lucky number 17 and 19 at $4.13 each.\n\nThe low armchairs are quite comfy... and music quite loud... I can only see my friend's mouth moving but cannot hear a thing.....it is quite dark inside too and everyone looks good?! Maybe just a little too much to drink?\n\nWaitress is super nice and ask if we need separate checks for our beers??"
0,"Not all Asian markets are made equal.  Tan Phat is no exception.  And we have not been impressed by this store...sadly, too, as it's so close to home.\n\nHere's the run down.  The organization of the store is fine.  At one end they have large refrigerators (maybe freezers?) and kitchen tools/dining supplies.  At the other they have produce.  Along the back wall they have a variety of fresh meats.  I'll admit, we've bought very little here, though partly because we were unable to FIND what we were looking for.  Everything in between seems to be organized by categories, some very specific some very broad: there's an aisle for rice noodles, almost exclusively, and another for Indian products.\n\nWhile the store is pretty large (two or three times the size of our favorite little Viet store back in Utah), the selection seems to be pretty sparse.  The shelves have a lot of the same taking up a lot of the space.  We have tried to find flat broad wheat noodles (which seem to be hard to find in Phoenix, to be fair) and Hon-dashi, both to no avail.  We also were unable to find anything but soft tofu on one visit.\n\nI think the biggest hang up for me, just before the lack of merchandise, is the difficulty we've had in communicating with the staff.  While I'm by no means an ardent believer of \""In Murica we speak English!\"" I feel that if you're going to open a business that does draw a diverse clientele (I've seen others of various backgrounds, who also don't speak Vietnamese) it's important to expand your vocabulary enough to meet the needs and answer the questions of patrons.  This does not appear to be a priority for this business, and, as such, we're willing to make the drive to LF Market on Bell Rd instead.\n\nI've also noticed others mention the cleanliness of the store and, well, I don't really care, to be honest.  I've noticed lots of stores similar to Tan Phat are comparably dingy.  It's not a priority for me, though.  I actually kind of like that feel over the sterilized feeling in most American grocery stores.\n\nNow, if you speak Vietnamese, and your wants are within their stock, by all means, come here.  We still do, sometimes, but it's certainly _not_ our go-to store."
0,"Terrible experience. I wish I could give negative stars or no stars. Placed an online order and paid with a credit card recently. The driver was 20 mins late! The pizza and wings were not hot. We called this location advised that our order is late and food was lukewarm. The person that answered advised that they were busy, didn't apologize and supposedly gave a $5 credit for our next order. \n\nDays later, looked at my credit card account statement and was CHARGED AN EXTRA $3!!!! This is CC fraud! Best believe I contacted this location very upset. Supposedly they are firing the delivery driver because we are the second caller to report this kind of incident. Makes me wonder how many other innocent people they are doing this to and other things. Businesses like this do not deserve to be open. If this is a franchised location, shame on the person running this. This is not a way to run a business. Maybe just simply hire deserving, trust worthy people that do their job.  \n\nIf anyone has to order from this Pizza Hut for whatever reason: Words of advise - check your order, keep track of the time from when your order was placed and pay in cash."
0,"Service sucks.  The hostess (surly, middle-aged blond) was unbelievably rude.  I don't know if she was having a bad day, but she did not need to take it out on customers.  No tacos are worth that attitude.  Good riddance.\n\n(PS on Apr 3)- I see other reviews suggesting the surly middle-aged blond may have been the owner.  That is so much worse than a nasty hostess.  If I could give this place a 0 stars, I would.  :("
1,"I love this place! The Meatball sandwich is great and so are all the pastas. Completely authentic and not gross like a cheapy Italian Restaurant.\nEverything is good from the bread, to the meatballs, to the side salad. Order the half portion or full portion of all their menu items and it will not disappoint. Expect to wait a 1/2 or more for your food to arrive though, it will not be done quickly but it will be worth the wait. Call ahead if you are in a hurry! The desserts are also delicious, not to mention it contains a market with a surplus of Italian ingredients to make your own meal at home. Your Italian Grandma would be so proud!"
0,"Decided to stop by here (for the first time) last week for a quick fix. I'm not sure if this was an isolated incident, but this was not up to par with the consistency that I would expect eating at any other golden arches restaurant. In fact, both my Big Mac and my girlfriend's were surprising dry! I'm sorry but the secret sauce was not enough to save them! To top it off, we order combos and they really skimped out on the fries (the french fry containers were not overflowing full as I'm used to getting from other Mickey Dee's). \n\nAlso, since they were new and for a \""limited time\"" (and thank the man upstairs for that), we tried out the McBites instead of our usual McNuggets, only to find ourselves in utter disappointment. The McBites were super dry and very hard with very little meat to be found. They were more like fried batter that were sitting too long under a heat lamp. I'm not sure if I'd ever give this location a try again, there were just too many strikes in one instance. Moreover, we went through the drive-thru so it's not like we could've complained to the manager if we ate inside. Overall, this was a bad first impression at this location."
0,"Food is decent.  \n\nThe tater tots are particularly good.\n\nBeer is pretty good, too.\n\nHowever, I don't agree with their smoking policy.\n\nIf I want to sit outside, I should be able to sit wherever I want and not have to inhale second-hand cigarette smoke.\n\nThe Vig is now officially boycotted and I will schedule all of my business meetings elsewhere."

0,"Went in for my first and ONLY time (won't bother again) for a french manicure with gel coating = $35\nIssues - mediocre manicure, and uninterested nail techs, and the TV was not on for entertainment/distraction... \nThe worst part to me was that they use UV machines to assist with drying the polish - for over FORTY minutes during the painting process! This bothered my eyes and my skin, as the machines become very hot and uncomfortable. When I tried to communicate my discomfort 20 minutes in, my concerns were brushed off."
0,"My family wanted to eat a good and cheap Christmas dinner as we were going to hit the buffets the next day. Known for the prime rib and steak and egg specials, Victorian Cafe was our destination that cold Christmas night. We got there around 9:30 PM and although there were a few empty tables, we were seated about ten minutes after we got there. Something about having to wait for the waitress to seat us. \n\nAnyway, I scanned the Yelp reviews on what was good, and decided to go with their prime rib special, which is usually $12.99 but on that day, was raised to $13.99. Too bad the steak and egg special is valid only after 11 PM. Each prime rib special comes with a salad or soup and fries, mashed potatoes or a baked potato. And of course, the table gets a basket full of hot rolls and butter. \n\nThe salad and rolls were delicious, but we all wanted to save our appetites for the prime rib. (We all ordered the same thing, haha). The prime rib comes out a while later, which made us all think that ... man, they must have run out of prime rib, so they're cooking us some good fresh one! When it arrived, each one was pretty darn big. Mine was a little bigger than the size of my hand! Unfortunately, the prime rib tasted really weird. It didn't even taste like meat! I felt like I was chewing on some weird variation of prime rib (almost like a vegetarian prime rib). It tasted like an imitation, and not at all like how prime rib usually tastes. Needless to say, my family and I were all very disappointed. We had to force the prime rib down, and this was the first time we actually had food left on our plates that we did not take back in a to-go box. \n\nGood service, good salad and bread, but sucky prime rib! The crust was too salty and the meat was too rubber tasting. We were confused as the meat was pink - not overcooked, but just not tasting the way it should. The ambiance was nice with dim lighting and booth seating (tables as well), but that prime rib was a shame."
0,"If there was a possible zero, this place would get it. But, Yelp felt the need that all business deserve pity stars. \n\nFrom upon entering, we're greeted by an Asian fellow with glasses. There were two-three tables open for 10...he reluctantly seated us and was about to put us on a waiting list. If not mentioned, we would have wasted our time. \n\nSoup is less than mediocre, broth was bland and constumer service was blatantly disrespectful. We asked multiple times for simple sides like onion, and waiters would not acknowledge our requests. \n\nJust to top off the cake, there was curly hair in my #10 soup. The cashier was apologetic, but not by nature. She looked at my wife and I, trying to find out if the hair belong to one of us. The hair was curly and short, possibly armpit hair. For her to stare up and down at us, it was very offensive, we did not plan to eat someone else's pubes. For a restaurant that cries it is the number 1 soup restaurant, they sure treat us like we are the last people to come back."
1,"This place is AWESOME!!  When my friend said Esquire magazine listed these as \""the best pancakes in America\"", and he had tried them and agreed, we went and now I totally agree! We kept going back on our trip to Vegas, and I will definitely recommend this to friends.  \n\nWe ate breakfast here a few times, lunch, and deserts.  Everything is fresh.  The OJ is like drinking an orange.  The pancakes are fabulous, buttery, kind of crisp on the outside and perfect fluffy on the inside, with delicious syrup!  It is too much to finish when you get the breakfast for $8 that includes an egg, two plate sized cakes, and two sausages or bacon slices.  The portions are, of course, Vegas sized.  The bread is fresh baked and you can taste it.  Pie is delicious, all tastes homemade.   The chocolate strawberry pie had actual big strawberry pieces in side the creamy chocolate.  Amazing!  \n\nThe second breakfast I tried the was hashbrowns, bacon, and toast. Potatoes were great, and bacon cooked right.  The only thing I didn't like was the jelly for toast.  Way too sugary and would have preferred a homemade type jam, but if that is the only complaint who cares?  \n\nDuPar's is on Fremont, in the Golden Gate, at the very back corner across from the Plaza.  If you go early for breakfast it is less crowded.  It is an old Vegas place, but don't let the outer casino judge the inside of Du-Par's.  It is well worth the visit. \n\nService is fast, friendly, food comes quick and hot, and it truly is great!  Prices are also fantastic in a city where the strip prices are ridiculous.  It is an old-school restaurant with a lunch counter, booths, and waitresses in white hats.  \n\nDefinitely try the pancakes.  Something I rarely order at breakfast.  They are classic!  \n\nGo Go Go to Du-Par's!!!!!"
0,Oh dear Diablo Cantina...\nNo more specialty cocktails for you. If the Sinful Vixen was just a taste of what your bartenders have up and created I think I should have a whack at altering your recipes. I will say this though their cocktails might be bad but the chips and salsa is delicious and well the bartenders aren't too shabby themselves.
0,"I had heard about Gullifty's even before I moved to Pittsburgh.  It has the reputation of a charming neighborhood spot with very good desserts.  Many claim their desserts are the best in Pittsburgh.  My recent visit there was not  memorable, not particularly bad but nothing to write home about (sorry ma.). I give them props for making their own desserts in house but despite the large selection, too many options seem like something you could get at Eat n Park or Applebee's in a slightly more commercialized  form.  Oreo, peanut butter, brownies on top- Don't get me wrong- this sounds decadent but it's date night, not my post-toke meal at Dairy Queen.  With that said, the desserts we had were pretty tasty.  Not best of Pittsburgh tasty, however.  I would have liked some more creative options.  The savory options were basically your usual diner entrees but the variety and flavor were both decent.  The service was average, friendly but untrained.  As for the decor, they need a facelift badly.  It looks like 1985 in there and not in a pleasingly retro sort of way.  There is a small but adequate selection of microbrews which is certainly a positive.  I think if I come back to Gullifty's any time soon, it would probably be for a late night slice of pie or coffee.  Otherwise,it's a pretty run of the mill establishment."
1,"Went here for the Red Velvet cake.  Overrall, service was wonderful (let me know how long it would take for them to get it packed for to-go and cashier was very courteous.  Seating is wide and place is overall clean.  Pretty pricey for a one cake, would be enough to share.  Very moist and the cream wasn't over bearing.  Will have to stop by again to try out the dishes they have to offer.  Smelled nice when I was waiting by the kitchen area. \n\nParking is easy, lot is decent sized."
0,Overpriced Hawaiian food
0,"my SO and I went there on a whim as we were walking around the Verdun area! We love Indian food and were excited to discover this place.\nFirst and foremost: they had two groups of 8 having dinner that night. I know they were groups of 8 because it took 1 hour 45 minutes for our food to arrive due to a simply terrible service. so yes, I had the time to count. They could have brought us some bread... or SOMETHING, or told us about the delay, but we were ignored the whole time. I hoped that the appalling delay would be compensated by great flavor. I am reading the other reviews here and I'm confused: did you know butter chicken should not taste like sugar was dropped in it, or have you just skipped on the authentic Indian your whole life? I don't mean to sound pretentious (oh well...) but the flavor was not there, the food tasted like something I could have made in my slow cooker at home, but LESS flavorful. So disappointed! \n\nOn the flip side, the Samosa I had as an appetizer was good! So that earns you a star. And a pity star. Because I dislike feeling like I HAVE to write a bad review, but you guys need to step up your service and food game."
0,"This place was in the middle of renovations when I stayed in Vegas.  They charged my debit card a hundred dollars and my credit $300, instead of figuring a way to get that on my bosses card, as I was on a business trip.  The place was confusing and advertised restaurants were no longer in operation.  I liked my room fine and the little bar under the non smoking tower, but I found the service overall to be lackluster and nothing special."
1,"I used Solis for both a mammogram and an ultrasound. The wait to be seen was not bad and they had great magazines in the waiting room. Once I was see the doctor was quite helpful. She really took the time to explain everything with me, including my options for treatment.\n\nHopefully I will not have to get another mammogram, but if I do,  this is where I would go."
1,"My server Alyssa was amazing. Very kind, always had a smile on her face and made sure everything was good with us. Also her manager Marc was amazing and making sure we enjoyed our service. I will definitely be returning and telling my friends about the wonderful service and food."
0,Service was slow. Menu is overpriced for what is basically pub food.  The stir fry and curry are advertised as vegetarian but when we double checked they both contain fish sauce. Charged full price even though my entree only contained half the ingredients. Not returning.
0,"In the day, before I had any incline of indie coffee chains(pre Yelp) and when my favourite place to chill out after work was Waterstones, the coffee supplied by its previous occupiers, was more than just well coffee...I mostly went there for the banter, from the baristas.\n\nSo tell me Edinburgh what's happened to this bookywooky shop? Really do nice cakes make up for the gapping chasm of friendliness and passion that used to lure me back week upon week; I think not! Somehow it has left me less warm to the chain since the renovation, just like a random wifi connection.\n\nYep the black/cream walls could do with a good lick of paint, the toilets could be more welcoming, the dwindling book stock could be more...stocky! New coffee team, different position of the coffee shop(why change it if it ain't broken) this place is in real danger of of going either one of two ways. Either turning into an abode that resembles Black Books or a massive Kindle shop? I know which one  I'd prefer?\n\nGod help me if one day I go in and Bernard Manny and Fran are sitting drinking red wine in the corner, swatting strange unseen creatures, while they discuss the reasons not to throw a kindle in the bin, or end the suffering of book lovers and give this place back the dignity and charm it deserves or put it out to pastures new.\n\nI did like coming here, but now as I know it's lost a few regular customers, dropped a few more books since I started writing this email and not really made many inspirational changes to keep me from going elsewhere then apologies to them.\n\nBut if your gonna subtract something then if you add something else you really should multiply to get better results. With great power comes greater responsibility so please Waterstones be even greater and more responsible!"
1,Very tranquil place to eat with a beautiful patio. The menu has a variety so no problem finding something that you'd like. Just right portions and can't beat the complimentary Champagne with brunch.
1,One of the best habachi and sushi restaurant in vegas!! EXCELLENT food and GREAT customer service.
0,"My husband loves teryaki, but the service here sucks...The crab rangoon was dry, hard and burnt the worst ever...The guy behind the counter gave me my own plastic bag, to bag up the containers in, really? What restaurant does that....they need some training in customer service and being professional. ..There is definitely no pride in their work....just lazy...."
0,Horrible exprience! Husband was kicked out for smoking his e cig when a bouncer saw him.  he had been puffing it all night in the vip room and no one said anything.  told him he needed to get his f****** s***out of there then called him a faggot.  I got a little mouthy with the bouncers.  They assulted me knocked me down and actually broke my foot! I have the medical records to prove it!  this night turned out to be a nightmare!!!! Hate this place...bouncers are out of control!!! Never Again!
0,"We were attempting to purchase a home in the Vegas area and in this tight market, needed everything to go smoothly in financing in order to not have our deal fall through.\n\nNot only did our loan officer not make the process smooth, he overlooked simple qualifications that needlessly ate time. We had to change loan types in between because he did not look at the debt on our credit report correctly and so we had to restart the whole process which burned a week.\n\nWhile the credits markets were rocky over the couple of weeks we were obtaining this loan(which we could have avoided had simple conditions not been overlooked earlier) our officer used it to change between rates as high as 4.5% to 3.75% back to 4% with added costs that were not disclosed earlier. Not only do I watch markets anyways, a week with a fluctuation like the one described above would be catastrophic in the economy. \n\nWe were in constant need to do financial gymnastics to pay down loans and meet conditions which is not the fault of WJ Bradley completely (mortgage laws are crazy now), but the lack of warning and preparation was, and again, could have been avoided had our officer been more attentive.\n\nWe did not get low costs or good rates with WJ Bradley, nor did we receive competent service to justify the higher costs."
0,"The food was drab and not worth the price. The only good thing is the decor. The entire restaurant has a loom theme which is unique and interesting. Overall, take pictures from outside but avoid the food."

0,"Update as of 8/13-took my dogs for boarding for the day. Lady @ front (curly mullet/obese ) was very rude and unprofessional. And slow! Also- The girl that came out to take my dogs for boarding was so quiet & looked afraid of people & dogs, Not warm & reassuring the way someone That handles animals should appear. She Just came out & Stood in front of me , not uttering  a word. After a few seconds she reached her hand out for my\nleashes, so socially awkward. I felt like I was in a Woody Allen /Tim Burton movie. These people are creepy and not cool. I'm done w this place..\n\n\n\n\nClean and nice facility ,good for minor services for your furry babies ( nail trim, grooming etc). Overpriced for major services and I wasn't so impressed with the vet."
1,"Stayed here since I was attending a trade show that was taking place at this location.\n\nWhen I travel for work I do not have too many requests - all I want is a clean room, good internet connection and close to the trade show I am attending. I will say the Rio met all of my expectations and it was cheap too. I ended up getting a suite for about $40 a night.\n\nOne night the people next to me were being very loud around 11 pm so I did end up calling security. They came up and took care of this very fast. I do understand that people typically come to Vegas to party but  I really needed my sleep.\n\nI will say the hotel if off the strip so if you are coming for non-work trips you might want to stay someone on the strip so you do not have to pay for expensive cab rides."
0,"I try to avoid this airport at all costs while connecting to other destinations.  The terminals have no tram or train and are VERY far apart from each other.  On more than one occasion the people-movers have been down for repair which makes that feature even more annoying.\n\nThe bathrooms have this hallway that is only wide enough for ONE person to fit through which makes going through with bags entertaining; especially when a flight arrives and the area is crowded with passengers rushing to the restrooms.  Yes, that's \""one person\"" for both directions.\n\nThen to add to the fun there was a last minute gate change AND it took them 20 minutes to get the jet-way to the plane.  Good times."

1,"Can I say enough good things about Bouchon?  The answer is no.\n\nI LOVE Bouchon.  I've been here for both brunch and dinner and given the financial means, I'll continue to go back.\n\nBrunch was absolutely delightful.  I love the natural sunlight that bathes the restaurant and view looking out towards the Venezia pools.  They have really good coffee, which is a staple in a brunch place.  We ordered beignets with nutella and homemade blackberry jam.  I ordered the Gravlax, a fresh and light DIY plate.  While you can get this dish at a lot of other brunch places, it was really refreshing and I wanted something light since I didn't want to hate my life after a heavy brunch.  \nSide note: I would highly recommend NOT ordering drinks for brunch.  My mimosa was $12.50, average, and in retrospect not really worth it.  Stick with the food people.\nSide side note: I couldn't find the infamous chicken & waffles on the menu. Unless I'm blind, it may be a special.  Next time, I'll definitely ask.\n\nMy dinner experience was a few months back with a group of 8.  Our server, bless his heart I can't remember his name, was outstanding and exceptionally professional, helpful, and informative.  He was the epitome of what service in a restaurant owned by a James Beard award winning chef should be.  The foie gras special was possibly the best I've ever had and still makes my mouth water thinking about it.  I had the poulet roti.  My chicken was juicy, moist, flavorful, and just wonderfully delicious.\n\nGo to Bouchon.  Go for brunch.  Go for date night.  Go for a business dinner.  Go alone.  Just go."
0,"I attended this even last year and had my gripes about organization and parking.  I had purchased VIP tickets.  Long lines were the norm but overall not bad. My tickets gave me some shaded seating, a bathroom, appetizers, 6 alcoholic drinks an free soda and water and $10 in food tickets. Overall a good experience. \n\nAgain this year I bought the VIP tickets and after reading that some things changed I anticipated being annoyed and disappointed- which happened. First, I was directed to park an obscene distance from the entrance even when the lot was not full on the north end. Easily 1/2 mile away from entrance.  I got right in however, but I arrived when it opened to try and beat some of the lines this year. \n\nVIP was not so much VIP however. They added more seating- out in the open sun and only a handful of standing tables under the shade.  Bathrooms were just port-a-potties with hand sanitizer- last year there were two portable bathrooms with running water. My 6 drinks now included soda and water, no more complimentary non alcoholic beverages. As for those alcoholic ones, pathetic. Last year a full bar was available along with beer and wine. This year? Select beers, wine, and premade cocktails in a bucket. IN A BUCKET. WTH? I'm not a college kid in rocky point for spring break.  Vodka lemonade and rum punch- poorly mixed to boot- are sad excuses for cocktails. \n\nNo appetizers were included this year and those $8 in food tickets? Well I used them in one fail swoop at Montana BBQ next door. The cost of food was ridiculous especially with the portions of some. I saw a few trucks like tom's bbq giving very shareable potions for $8-10 but I got about 6 cheese curds for $4 at another truck. \n\nI would like to note some great trucks though- Franks hot dogs and Chuckies topped it for me. Both excellent and worth the small wait. Sammich did it awesome too.  Didn't bother with the Maine Lobster Lady. $20 and over an hour wait for a sandwich was not cutting it. I'm sure it is excellent but that hour plus wait was just to order the thing... I am a huge truck foodie and visit them wherever I travel. I'm all good paying $10 for lunch anytime but this was a truck festival. Smaller portions for less money make it possible to try several trucks. Come early too since even the dessert trucks had super long lines by 2 pm. Making it miserable to stand in lines in the sun. \n\nI hop they make some changes for next year, especially with that VIP ticket. I feel completely ripped off on that purchase this year. The trucks will always get my business but it may not include this festival."
0,"My experience (while physically there)  staying at the Valley Ho was great.

0,"My bf and I went to SW the last night of our stay at Encore. Dinner was at 9 because we made our reservations last minute. I ordered the filet with lobster macaroni and he ordered the bone in rib eye with potatoe puree. Both steaks were ordered medium. \n\nWhen the food arrived, the rib eye was made nicely while my filet was the driest piece of steak I've ever eaten. I only eat filet at steakhouses and the cheesecake factory makes better filet than here. The steak was tender but didnt have any moisture in it, when pressing down with a fork, no juice came out at all. Our server was MIA and I had to hunt down the water guy to get me some bernaise sauce. The server never came by once to ask how food was. Sadly, even the bernaise couldnt save the steak and I waited and waited for the server to walk by so I could tell him that there is no way I could eat that anymore. 5-10 min passed and I was ignored. Once again the water guy came and asked whether I needed anything and I told him to get me the waiter. The nice water guy told me that my steak looked like medium rare to him.\n\nFinally, a different waiter came to ask what's going on and promptly apologized for the steak. He offered a change and I settled on a fish dish. I never saw the 1st server acknowledge us again. The fish dish (ono) came and it was also terrible but since the new server tried, I decided to not say anything. \n\nThe only saving grace of the dinner was the dark chocolate souffle with vanilla ice cream. This was brough on by our 1st server and he dropped it on the table with a loud clunk, maybe he is pissed that was complained?\n\nOverall, I felt that I spent $160 on a rib eye and a souffle. I wish I could leave Vegas with a bang, but what a disappointment."
0,"hate to be a scrooge, but this place aint all that great.  been on various occasions, though just twice to eat and will say NO EFFING WAY the best fish and chips. deep sea, top of leith walk has the best, and ive had about 17 better. the first time we went for a sunday brunch we asked for the steak and onion baguette thingy. we asked if they could add cheese on and they said no. we said we would pay and they said no.  then proceeded to tell us that the only cheese they had wouldnt taste right melted. WTF. all cheese works on steak in my book.\n\nthe second time i went was with about 5 others and i will give them a bit of credit as we were came a bit late for breakfast. they were out of nearly everything!!!! no shit. everything that was asked for they were out of. they did have the bagel and salmon. it was a sad pititful little bagel that i wanted to throw a life jacket around and give mouth to mouth to after before offering a new life with a family whow would love and cherish it.\n\nhope dianna wasnt our server cause whoever we had (this was the second week of september, 2008) was HORRIBLE. we had to practically reenact the sesame street \""agua\"" \""agua\"" 80's skit with the guy crawling through the desert just to get a glass of water. ages to get the bill and by that time we were the only ones there.\n\nSUCKO SUCK SUCK MCGEE. you are surrounded by wayyyy better places to eat and drink. shit, id even eat at the waterline 100 feet away before this place"

1,"A great Brewpub!!  It is about half way between two of my favorite golf stores, so thankfully it  is very convenient for me.  They also have two of my favorite beers - Kilt Lifter and Oatmeal Stout. Consequently, I am here on a regular basis.\n\nI have stopped by at all times of the day - lunch, happy hour, and dinner.  I have to confess, I very seldom eat here - not because the food is bad - but simply because I am usually on my way one place or another.  What I have eaten - burgers, pizza, appetizers - all have been good, but not outstanding.  However, the portions are large and filling.\n\nWhat stands out are their beers.  Beside my two favorites, the IPA's are solid, and their specialty beers are outstanding.  \n\nAlthough it can get rushed at times, I have always had great service.  My only criticism is that sometimes they do not schedule correctly, and the poor servers are running to keep up.  They do a wonderful job, but you can tell that they have to many tables to serve. \n\nBe aware - it can get busy, particularly at night and during popular games. If you don't like crowds, or just want quiet conversation and drinking, it can be overwhelming."
0,"Sign outside says $4.99 for two entries. When you ask about it, they tell you that the sign is for some kind of buffet style food before 3pm. When I left I checked the she sign did not say anything about \""before 3pm\"". So there are you standing there ready to eat some food and you just order anyway. I did not really appreciate the bait and switch scam crap. The portions were decent although the food was kind of bland. I give one star because I did not like going in for the special advertised on the window and then told it is not available. That is not the proper way to run a business."

If that wasn't our FIRST bad sign.\n\nLast night at 9pm, (wasn't busy) we tried it & when we should have turned right back around. Same thing again. \""Yo, what can I get ya?\"", it was better than the last time. LOL we ordered two philly's. The guy took the time to ask me if I wanted onion. I said no onion PLEASE.

Mine came with hardly any prov. cheese, I had ONION & mushrooms weren't cooked! I thought they would of sauteed the mushrooms at the very least on the grill. A philly is supposed to be juicy, flavorful & and most of all LOADED.\n\nEven after the bad first expereince, I gave you the benefit of the doubt guy! I tipped & I still ended up feeling like I'm the bad guy. How does that work?\n\nI'm putting my foot down, this place deserves a one star rating. I hope the Owner reads these reviews.."
0,"I'm not sure what the Mt.Lebo hype is about this place. The portions are small, the place is small, and the foods no more than average. I have been there twice now, thinking the first time might have been a fluke. We've heard so much about it that I have super high expectations. Their wine bar in the back is cute, but small. We couldn't even lift our elbows to sip our drink. While the waiters and service are good, the food is just not impressive. The pasta I got was good, but nothing to write home about. I got a pizza the second time I visited and it had a horrid taste. I don't know if it was the spinach or the cheese but something was VERY potent. They're pricy as well. The only thing I will give them credit for their Italian wedding soup. There's practically nothing in it, as they use think rice instead of noodles, but the broth and meatballs are to die for! Overall, not impressed. I probably won't return."
1,"Fun games, coach and fire!  And great food..."
1,"I'm bumping them down to 4 stars. I still think this is a great local place, but their kitchen tends to be heavy handed with sauces.  The last time we went I got the panko crusted pork chop. It was a huge, tender cut but was drowning in a soy sauce-based sauce that was way too sweet. The service, as always, was excellent and they have Fat Tire on tap for 3 bucks. I'll still come back, but their cooks really need to lighten up with the sauces."
0,"The food is good but the service is awful. I placed an order online and waited three hours without my order being delivered. I call after and hour and a half and was told my order was on its way to me. I wait another hour and nothing so i called again and was told that they tried several times to contact me, my phone never rang. They also told me they tried to call me right after I place my order to let me know they could not deliver it, why didn't they tell me when I called? I will never order from here again. So very disappointed."
0,"We came to Bratalian for Restaurant Week 2014 and were very excited, given the excellent reviews. Although some aspects of our experience were good, overall it was weak enough that I don't think we'll be back. \n\nService: We called at about 5:15 to make a reservation, but the line did that fax machine screechy sound. Okay, then! We'll take our chances! On the ride there (it's about 25 minutes away from us), we worried that the place would be packed because of Restaurant Week so we called. The hostess was very accommodating and cordial, promising us a table. When we arrived, however, our luck with service changed. We didn't have a single server. Our order was briskly taken by one waiter, the food was dropped by another, and our dessert order was taken and delivered by the manager. The place was pretty busy, but other tables seemed to have good service. We felt overlooked and kind of like nuisances! The biggest issue is that they added an 18% gratuity and then taxed it. This is not typical procedure for Restaurant Week and I resented not necessarily having the gratuity added (I guess), but being taxed on it - I think - is in bad form. \n\nFood: From the Restaurant Week menu, we had the meatballs and fried calimari and zuchinni to start. Then, for our entrees, we had the linguine clams and the salmon with a lemon-butter sauce. For dessert, we had the profiteroles and the ricotta cheesecake. I thought the food was fine. The fried calamari didn't have much seasoning and was overly greasy; the dipping sauce on the side was a simple, plain marinara. If the calimari is going to be so plain, at least offer something a bit zestier for dipping. The meatballs were below average. They are VERY large, but, again, there wasn't much flavor. They were also a bit dense and dry; we were hoping for plump, juicy meatballs. The entrees were much better. The clams in the linguine were big and so flavorful. My salmon was probably the best part. The skin was crispy, the fish was cooked perfectly, the lemon-butter was succulent, and the sauteed spinach was a lovely compliment. If I come back, I would get the same entree. I was really looking forward to dessert because of other reviews, but I gotta say, the ricotta cheesecake didn't live up to the hype. I thought it was too dense and bread-y. The flavor was fine, but I didn't finish it because of the density. It was like a having a mouthful of wet sand! The profiteroles that my boyfriend ordered were good. The pastry was flaky and what can go wrong with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce?We had a half carafe of red wine along with our food, which gave us about 3 glasses total. \n\nAtmosphere: It's a small restaurant, but it's very cute. It's decorated perfectly and arranged so that it's size is not a problem. It's lively - lots of groups. There were a few slip-ups that night: a tray of dishes crashed, the smoke alarm went off in the kitchen. No major issues, really. Just added to the fun. The biggest \""atmosphere\"" problem for me is the broken lock on the women's room door. I struggled to get out of that bathroom for like five minutes, which doesn't seem like a long time until that's the amount of minutes you spend involuntarily in a bathroom. I had almost resigned myself to my new life as a bathroom-dweller, about to start fashioning a bed out of toilet paper, when I finally escaped. Bratalian, you've got to fix the door. \n\nOverall, it was just okay. The service was unexceptional and simply got the job done. The food was fine. Unfortunately, that's not really enough to have me come back."
1,"K'Os is a great place to go for happy hour. They have awesome specials and the drink prices aren't bad at all. I've been here multiple times, and I have never had bad service. The patio is a dog friendly patio, which is nice. We go there for the sports games because there are 6 different tv's outside playing the different games, and you can get a little sound box for your table that will play the audio for the game you want to watch, which I thought was super cool. If you're looking to have some fun and watch a game and have some drinks, I would suggest you try K'Os."
0,"I have been to this Smith & Wollensky location at least 5 times previously. At one time it was What Smith & Wollensky should be; A great steak house. Sadly, no more. \n\nI've been to at least 7 or 8 other Smith & Wollensky properties around the US. This meal, in a word, sucked. It wasn't so much that the food was so bad (it was not even good though), it was that the waiter lied. Flat out lied.\n\nThere were only 3 of us. Two ordered a filet and I ordered the aged rib steak. My steak was not an aged piece of meat. I know aged meat. It was fatty with a kind of fat that is not the texture seen in aged beef. It didn't have the rich beefy flavor that aged steak attains. It was also a bit overcooked...to about medium. Additionally, it shrank too much to be aged. When the food was delivered to the table, one of the filets was missing. The waiter said he put the order in. He didn't. We saw him put it into the computer. He had forgotten to put it in. I told him to take the two steaks back to the kitchen to re-fire and he said the one that was left in the kitchen would be out in a minute. It wasn't. It took 7 minutes. We timed it. By the time the third steak came out...neither of us wanted to eat without the other steak on the table...my $50 rib was cold and when our third guest finally cut into her filet, it was not medium rare...it was medium raw. Totally raw and cold in the middle. First, the waiter tried to say it was correct. It was blue, which is rarer than rare. He reluctantly took the steak back to the kitchen and it came back medium, not medium rare. We gave up. The manager sent over one of the massive desserts, which was nice but really didn't change the overall tenor of the meal.\n\nThe wine I ordered came with a different vintage. I really don't appreciate that. And it's beneath a restaurant wine list that's supposed to be the 'caliber' of S & W's wine list. Just because this S& W is on the Las Vegas strip doesn't mean the service, the wine list and the management suck. But they do. S&W here probably thinks that everyone is a tourist and will never darken their door again. Well, for sure i won't darken their door and I'm in Las Vegas at least 3 times a year and used to eat at S&W almost every time along with recommending this restaurant. No more.\n\nBad table waiting, bad management, bad food all around.\n\nToo bad. It could be a great oasis on the strip."
1,"Dr. Singel and his staff did a wonderful job!  I went to see him about a bone cyst and pathalogical fracture and he was in the room with me within 10 minutes of my appt time and he had already reviewed my info and checked out the MRI films I brought.  He knew exactly what I needed and referred me to an excellent orthopedic surgeon to get my foot taken care of.  His office was super quick in putting in the referral to my insurance company.  They were polite, knowledgeable, and professional and didn't keep me sitting around.  Thanks, Dr. Singel!"
1,"Dr. Gilchrist came to my house yesterday to check on my 2 cats.  Dr. Gilchrist and his associate were so warm and welcoming.  My cats were so comfortable with them!\n\nAfter going to Scardy Cat Hospital in Scottsdale since I moved here, I decided to try another doctor.  They wanted to pull between 6-10 teeth on my cats each!  That was going to be thousands of dollars and I thought it was really extreme because 2 years ago I took them and the doctor who started the clinic said they were fine.  The new doctor who has since taken over was the aggresive one.  Dr. Gilchrist said he didn't even see tarter on one of mine (8 and 7yrs respectively) and the other was just a little.  Nothing to worry about.\n\nWow!  What a difference!  My cats usually are stressed and lose a ton of hair after a vet visit and they were just fine when he left.\n\nI would recommend them in a heartbeat!"
1,"Chain, I know, but here is why an am writing a four star review: \n\nPicture this: Valentines Day, two kids in tow, one who wants a heart shaped pizza. Snow, cold, and we have all ready run five previous errands. I do not want to run another one. So I pray - please let there be a heart shaped pizza here. I scan the pizzas - no heart shaped pizza. My heart drops. Enter friendly pizza man asking if I need help finding anything. I answer, besides my sanity, a heart shaped pizza. He offers to make me one on the spot. I wipe away my tears of gratitude and thank him. \n\nIn a day where customer service is hard to find I was very pleasantly surprised to find someone who went the extra mile to help a customer knowing they probably wouldn't ever get recognized for it. \n\nWay to go!"
1,"This restaurant was suggested to us by the gal at the Roaring Fork, as they were not open for lunch. I had the turkey sandwich, it was like having Thanksgiving between two slices of bread! It was awesome! The staff was engaging, not taking offense to our preoccupation with trying to figure out why some people got white napkins and some got black napkins. Turns out their white napkins are \""linty\"" and they have had people complain, so they give out black napkins to anyone with dark pants on. Why anyone would complain to a restaurant  about lint on their trousers is an entirely different question. This place has great ambiance too. Check it out!"
0,"My wife and I both were first time customers to Val Vista Vision. Before going in I knew that I had monovision and a astigmastism. I knew that I could only get glasses, my wife though was told that she was a good candidate for contact lenses. Val Vista Vision charges $135 non-refundable fee. That fee went towards finding the correct contact, training and fitting for her. Her 1st pair (of contacts) my wife could not see distance or in low light level. She went in to see Dr. Stacie Eskew again and was told she had monovision. Dr. Eskew should have recognized this in the 1st exam. My wife went in several times to try different contacts and was told there no more options (she could not see distance in any of them) and she had to wear glasses. She asked since none of the contacts worked, to have partial of the $135 to go towards glasses and was told by contact lens specialist that they would not do that. We were disappointed, thinking Val Vista Vision would have better customer service than this. We will not return as customers or recommend them."
1,I went with a friend the other day and was really happy.\n\nIt's affordable (I hate the term cheap) and excellent.  \n\nI had the black bean burger and a cup of asparagus and mushroom soup.  It might have been the best soup I've ever had and the black bean burger was completely different than any that I've had before. I think it had something extra like fava beans to give it better texture and flavor.\n\nMy friend had the salmon burger which was also amazing (stole a bite).\n\nI think our total with both sandwiches and two excellent cups of coffee with soy creamer (yay!) was about $20.
0,"REALLY DISAPPOINTED !!!!  The atmosphere and service were great, the food portions were enormous -FIVE STARS FOR THOSE ASPECTS- but the food was so so. I had the Eggs  Benedict,  it was ok, my hubby had the Pacers Hash which was 80%  potatoes, the pork was tough and with absolutely no taste, he kept salting it, I actually told our waiter how disappointed he was with the Pacers Hash, he apologized and quickly took it off the table but offered nothing in place of it- my husband only ate maybe 30% of his food. My daughter had the #5 burger, I was surprised when she said was she was not happy with her burger either, due to lack of tasted.  Normally she wants her left over for breakfast - well, she wanted no part of it this morning-that is what prompted me to write this review. We must have gone on an off night, would  like to give it another try, but with their prices, we won't be going back."
1,"Came here with hubby on our first night in Vegas! I was so excited to find out it was one of Mario Batali's restaurants. \n\nHubby loved that they had maudite beer to drink, but he didn't love his spaghetti and meatballs all that much. \n\nI LOVED my pizza! I believe I had arugula, potatoes and truffle oil on a white pizza. It was so delicious, so saltly, so truffly! I almost ate the whole thing but couldn't finish it. \n\nThe atmosphere is incredible. This restaurant is inside of the Venetian hotel. It's located in a food court by the grand canal shoppes and it's set up to look like you are strolling through a square in Venice. \n\nDefinitely a great place to eat on the strip, slightly pricey but worth it IMO!"
1,"This is authentic Liberian food, I recommend the cassava leaf if it is available. The restaurant is basic but the food is good and spicy if you need it to be, ask for extra pepper."
0,"Disappointed with the service and the time it took to be served. Food was mediocre, lacked flavor and a bit dry...(chicken quesadilla, mahi-mahi tacos, fajitas). I prefer authentic mexican food...Leticia's in NorthWest. \nI expected more from Laredo Cantina...we weren't greeted with a smile, the server didn't refill our drinks, we had to wave him down a few times. The prices were decent however the portions were very small. I highly recommend for you to go elsewhere. Cafe Rio or Leticia's...Oooh Yeah!"
0,"Drove twenty minutes out of my way to get some vegan food at this whole foods. I went away empty handed because some manager in prepared foods came up and asked for certification for my service dog. You should teach your employees that you are not allowed to ask for certification under the American disabilities act. You are allowed to ask if the dog is a service dog and what service that dog provides. I informed the manager of this and he said that \""just so you know we have a sign that says only service dogs are allowed so if he's not a service dog you need to go\"" As someone with PTSD and severe anxiety I was mortified and left empty handed. The man was watching me in the store and standing at the door while I left. It made me feel really creeped out and uneasy. I will probably never return to this location. I Thanks for the public humiliation tonight.\n\nI called back to complain and the manager sounded very unapologetic. I'm now sitting at home on the verge of an anxiety attack. Probably will have to call into work tomorrow. Thanks guys."
1,"Love this memorial hall that commemorates the soldiers who fought in the various wars for this country. The Gettysburg Address is inscribed on the wall right about the stage and it adds to the Hall's nostalgic feel.  \n\nI love coming here every year for the Pittsburgh Bodybuilding championships. It's a cozy and intimate theater that's extremely comfortable to watch the stage from. \n\nOn an added note, this building was used to film one of the scenes from the movie, Silence of the Lambs"
1,"Nice looking restaurant, interesting food choices at very reasonable prices, good service and away from all the casino's smoke and bustle. \n\nWe went at about 10pm on a sunday and it was perfect for a romantic dinner experience. we sat in the patio, which has just the right amount of light and the music level is good for having a conversation. \nHowever, if you are looking for a different experience, you can sit inside or at the bar where the music is louder."
1,"First, our server, A.J.,  was top notch and was a major reason for our group of golf buddies enjoying a great evening at CPH. He had knowledge of the food and great personality.  The cocktails and food were delicious.  The only negative comments I can say is that the crab cakes need a little work. But the chopped salad, the burrata, the short rib, the scallops, and the meatloaf were fantastic.\nGreat restaurant with lots of energy."
1,"We came for lunch. The service was ok - the food was prettty good. The ahi on the salt stone was great. The meatballs were ok. The steak salad was good - the steak was a little over cooked for me, but that does not take much. My man friend had the sliders that were really good! \n\nWe had the sweet dessert thing (it was a taster) - the presentation was great, I was not a huge fan of the pb&j donuts, but I have had worse.\n\nIf you are staying at the Encore or the Wynn and don't feel like leaving - it is not a bad option. I would not order a normal drink there, as they were small and expensive, but their custom drinks looked pretty good. I also noticed there was a bloody mary bar, which looked fun, but I didn't try it."
1,"I hosted a group dinner for 10 people at Province a few weeks ago.  We sat on the patio on a gorgeous night.  Our visit started off a little shaky, but they quickly rebounded.  We really enjoyed the food and the service was good.  I love that they have wine on tap - yummy!"
0,We always go to the Pub on Eastern in Henderson. The food is usually great but at this one it sucks! We ordered 3 steak specials all rare. Each one came out different. One was so raw it didn't even have grill marks on it. We had to wait 20 mins for drink refills. I wouldn't suggest this location to anyone.
1,"The most disappointing part of going to Au Pied de Cochon for lunch? Not being able to try the 15 different things I wanted to order.  There is nothing \""light\"" about anything on the menu here, and that's the way it should be. \n\nEverything we ordered was rich and decadent, from the terrine to the \""sugar pie\"", and the foie in between, everything was delicious. Hope to be back in Montreal soon, just to get to have a few more meals here."
0,"RUDE OWNER, BORING FOOD, TOO SPENDY FOR 'BAR-FOOD'\n\nI work and live downtown, yet have never been to this restaurant. Today I checked the Groupon Now! deal site and saw Steve's offering an $8 for $12 Now! Deal. I decided to try something new, and as I only ever get 'to-go' lunch, confirmed this was allowed to use the deal. \n\nCalled in my order ahead, waited the suggested amount of time before heading over, then waited at restaurant for order. Once my order was ready, I was presented with bill for $14.26 ($13 entree + tax). I presented the Groupon worth $12. Server said, \""I'll have to see if I can use this.\"" Went to the back area and returned with a female employee. They discussed something I couldn't make out, then server came back to me with bill of $4.26. Before handing him my card, I asked why it was $4.26, instead of $2.26 ($14.26 bill - $12 Groupon = $2.26 balance). Before he could speak, the female employee behind the bar spoke up, rudely and loudly, saying [paraphrased], \""I always add a tip to to-go's, to give these guys a chance to make money. I assume you would tip them anyway.\"" I asked her why this wasn't part of the terms, that she is not allowed to force gratuity on a customer when not explicitly stated in the terms. She said, again raising her voice to me unnecessarily, \""I am the owner and have already told Groupon to change the terms to not allow to-go orders. I don't even have to accept it.\"" I reminded her that as the customer this is not my issue, but hers with Groupon, and that I am not obligated to pay tip or required to dine-in to redeem this deal, as the deal's terms did not state either. Again, she was extremely rude and loud, saying that the point of the deal was to bring customers in to sit and dine, not to get a to-go. \n\nDeciding it was pointless to attempt to converse such an ignorant individual, I informed her that she lost that opportunity because I would never be back. She continued to speak over me and ignored my attempt at discussing the issue as an adult. \n\nNot sure why she couldn't explain this to me calmly, as a rational 'business owner', but instead allowed the the server to present me with a incorrect bill. Why not personally explain the mistake on the Groupon terms (that they do not allow to-go's on Groupons or that she would request a gratuity included in my charge), and earn a customer, instead of alienating one? . Instead, she successfully removed any chance that I will patron this establishment again. \n\nWith all the other delicious, super-friendly, and locally-owned/runned lunch options in the downtown area, I feel patrons should be aware of this business's practices. Not sure about you, but I would rather NOT be inaccurately billed, berated and fussed at by a restaurant employee during my lunch. Your choice!\n\nOh... and after all that, how did the pasta taste? Eh -- nothing special. Like boiled noodles with canned cream sauce, and two strips of over-cooked chicken. Went to Chipotle instead :)"
1,"Terrie really made our experience. I love Applebees anyway, but she really treated us like we were the only table she had. \n\nWe walked in at 11:11pm on a Sunday, the place closes at midnight. We were just going to get a quick bite so they could close. Terrie was very friendly and honest about what I should order to get a good deal. I tried the wonton tacos and they were delicious. We also had spinach and artichoke dip, they gave us lots of chips and Terrie helped us box them up with some extra salsa. \n\nNext time I am in Phoenix and want Applebee's, I will go to this location simply because of the service we received."
1,"I remember eating here after my cousin's wedding and I kept wondering where they got the fish from. It's Las Vegas, the desert, with no ocean or river currents flowing in or out of the area. Where do Las Vegas restaurants get their fish anyways?\nTo make it better it was my first time going to a Joe's Crab Shack, it was good and the fish tasted awesome."

0,"I can't comment on the food because we didn't get that far.  The place had a less than pristine feel when we walked in, but we were willing to overlook that.\n\nIt was when we watched the hostess toss her hair around (literally bending over at the waist to flip it forward then all the way back) and proceed to put her hair up in a ponytail, take it out and then repeat the process, that we decided we didn't have the stomach to eat there."
1,I stopped here for lunchtime dim sum with two friends on my birthday. It was delicious! Lots of options and different sauces with almost every dish. The server was fantastic - working with me on my sensitivity to shrimp and constantly swooping in for refills. The owner/manager stopped over to chat with us and was sweet and funny. Can't wait to take a group back!
1,"Fun, original, full of taste and an exciting menu. I brought my mother who is not vegetarian at all and she loved the \""fake meat\"" plates she took.

0,"After reading the other yelp reviews I was looking forward to trying this place.  I generally like asian food. Unfortunately it didn't deliver\n\nI had the chicken teriyaki bowl on brown rice.  The flavors didn't mix well.  The teriyaki seemed more like straight soy sauce and the carrots were raw.\n\nI also ordered the lettuce wraps (I was hungry) which were slightly better.  The sauce was flavorful but the chicken filling seemed like they put it in the blender for too long.\n\nThere aren't a lot of great food options in the Charlotte airport but unless you are craving Asian stir fry, I would look elsewhere"
0,my husband and i stayed here because we bought a travel zoo voucher we had a suite  but the hotel was very boring no one was in the club and the sports lounge was a joke it was playoffs and it was only three couples there.  This place must be going out of business wont be back the room was average
0,"Let's start with the staff here on the afternoon I dropped in:\n\nInattentive, lazy teenagers whose main concern was to talk to their friends who, yes, did happen to be placing orders. However, that does not give anyone working in a position such as theirs the ability to ignore TWO other customers waiting in line to order. Because the employees here decided it was more important to talk to their friends, I waited 10 minutes just to place my order.\n\nAfter placing my order I then proceeded to wait for another 10 minutes as drink after drink came out before mine. I left with my drink as soon as I got it. I can't even say I liked the boba tea. It was okay, I guess. But I suppose I was just soured from the whole experience, I couldn't even enjoy my drink.\n\nI think this place must be good. Everyone on Yelp raves about it. But my experience was bad. No more Easy Life boba for me."
0,"In hopes that TGI's would bring a little more to the table then what Sam's Town puts out...wishful thinking. I would much rather head out to the food-court, order a Big Mac and watch that howling wolf, then to spend $30 at this place again. \n\nI have generously given them an extra star due to the \""major crisis\"" our server claimed they were experiencing during our visit. Needless to say, it took a good while to get menus, and twice as long to get drink orders in. \n\nWe ordered Buffalo Wings from their Happy Hour. Wings were cold and had an odd flavor. The fries came later when we were almost finished eating our Wings. They were SO salty, we ended leaving the entire basket. Our Mozzarella sticks were delicious, and earned a whole whoopin star for great taste and freshness!! Cheese was fresh and stringy, just like a cheese stick should look. \n\nOther than our cheese sticks, everything about this location was below average."
0,"After hearing that the sushi chef from Sushi Mon on Sahara had moved here we had to check it out.  I do enjoy their fried oysters and dynamite.  However, the quality of the fish is just so-so.  Maybe I'm spoiled by the high quality of fish I've been eating at my new regular spot, Naked Fish http://www.yelp.com/biz/naked-fishs-sushi-and-grill-las-vegas\n\nHowever about halfway into our meal, we were shocked when we saw them clean the inside of the glass sushi display case with a big blue bottle of windex.  Yes, the case with all the fish in it.  \n\nWe walked out.  That is wrong.  Won't be going back."

1,"I have been a Real Estate Broker in Chicago for 2 years and I just moved to Scottsdale to do the same. In order to be in RE in AZ, I had to take all the classes and exams all over again which I wasn't looking forward to... I heard from a friend broker that ASREB is the best school and I signed up for the 9 day crash course. I thought there was no way I was going to be ready to take exam after 2 weeks of classes- it took me much longer to get ready in Chicago! Passing the school and state exam from the first try proved me wrong! The classes were not only very informative and interesting but fun as well. All instructors have a great sense of humor and made studying fun (which after sitting in class for 9 hours made it much easier)! Special thanks to Kevin McClure, Randy Cooney, Bill Gray, David Whiting, & Randy Helfman for making the classes fun and easy to learn!\nAlso, the front desk customer service is excellent! I had to find someone to proctor my exam for IL CE and asked Kara for help. She arranged everything for me to take it and sent the results to my instructor in Chicago. She made the process easy and effortless on my side. Thank you for all the help! I am definitely taking all my future classes and seminars in this school!"
1,"First time here, love the vibe. Got a seat outside on the patio. Had great service from Melinda. She hooked it up w a tasty pancake while we waited for our food. My harvest Benny ended up not being my fav which wasn't a big deal to me but the management ended up giving me a discount. I dig this place. Everyone that works here seems happy which feeds the over all positive welcome vibe."
0,"Not sure how this is the first one star review of this place... but here goes.\n\nDriving home today, I wanted something QSRish, but without a drive thru since my three year old would have insisted on getting french fries. Since Wednesday is not Fry-day, except last week when Penn Central was giving them away for free, I wasn't about to alter course and give in to her jones for fries.\n\nSo, I decided get some take out from Asian 1. We had heard bad things about this place, but had never tried it before. I guess it was my duty to fall on the grenade to definitively put whatever nails in the coffin this place needed in our household.\n\nFirst off, this must be a money laundering front for the Chinese mob. There were two people in this place. It looked like the kitchen hadn't been used all day except to prepare lunch for these two. I have rarely seen people going in and out of this place, so it's not like today was an anomaly. I decided to go basic and order General Tso's because, how can you f*** up General Tso's right? It came with an egg roll and my choice of rice. Price was under $6... the ONLY positive.\n\nThe egg roll was among, if not the worst I've ever had. And this comment is coming from a man who has eaten Takee Outee egg rolls on Bourbon Street. Those were better. There wasn't enough sweet and sour sauce available to make this tasteless fried cylinder of wonton tasty.\n\nThen came the General Tso's. It wasn't even mall food court quality. It was pretty weak. Very little spice...like they sprinkled a bit of cayenne in their sweet and sour sauce. The meat was probably not chicken.. and if it was, it was McNugget quality. The flash frying of whomever provides the pre-cooked breaded chicken for this place pretty much reduced what meat was inside the breading to mere molecules.\n\nSeriously, if you are driving down Ardrey Kell and you want Asian, skip Asian 1 and go into Harris Teeter... pick up either frozen PF Changs or Wanchai Ferry. So what if you have to cook it yourself... it's a small price to pay versus getting food at Asian 1."

And don't expect any \""eye candy\"".   If you don't want to pay much for a haircut and are fine with someone running a clippers through your hair, then this isn't a bad place."
0,"I would say that this place is impressive but then I'd be lying, the servers and hosts were very rude, we made reservations for 11:45 am and were told when we arrived that they don't take reservations and then we were  told they do, then they told us you we would be texted when your tables were ready, an hour  and a half go by,  and still no text, so then we go up and ask what's going on and we are told that we cannot sit together and that if we wanted tables together it was going to be an 18 % gratuity in addition to  the already 600$ bill for breakfast, being that we were a party of 11 that would normally make sense but being that this is a BUFFET,  we were not having it, when a manager finally came she was rude and unapologetic, and seemed to roll her eyes and just generally was very unprofessional, she told us basically she can't do anything, then rudely said I will get the general manager and he can explain it to you the same way I did and maybe you'll understand. Another  thing the subordinate manager said later on that was rude was when she had us being taken to our seats  she told the host to make sure she split us up,even after all the hassle of simply letting us sit together , so the general manager comes out and before he did they were telling us that even if we split up into two groups we'd still be charged gratuity and the tables wouldn't be close, finally we get sat and and the general manager was able to take off the gratuity and we got two tables and they were semi close. The food was great until a few hours later when my stomach was unsettled and I threw my 600$ meal up. Long story short, I would never return there and strongly advise others against it as well, the only reason it gets 2 stars is because the food was decent, service is terrible and aside from the general manager, management was very unprofessional."
0,"We got into town at lunchtime.  Our room at Caesars wasn't ready so we decided to wait it out by having a light lunch at Central Michel Richard.  Carol W and I were well versed in Michel Richard's cuisine having dined at his Citronelle and Central in Washington D.C. and had previously dined for breakfast at Central Michel Richard and had walked away pleased.  This time...not so much. \n\nWe were joined by our respective families and seated promptly at a large round table in the sunny, airy dining room just off the Caesars' main lobby.  From this point on, our experience spiraled into the ground almost solely due to a series of missteps by our server.   Carol W recounted our difficulty in getting any drinks beyond water in her review.  Let me add that we got up from the table, went to the bar, and asked the bartender if she could make any cocktails regardless if they were on the list or not.  She could.  So, service strike #1.  I can say with 100% certainty that our server lost beer and alcohol sales to our party.  Since we had early evening dinner reservations for later that day, several people in our party asked how big portions were for several items on the menu.  Our server didn't impress us with his knowledge or familiarity with the menu as his estimates on portion size were dramatically off.  Service strike #2.  \n\nI had the plain Goat Cheese Caesar ($18 for Total Rewards members/$19/add chicken $6, filet mignon $13).  It was a nice looking salad, not over-dressed or overly salty, and possessing good flavor.  However, IT WAS A SALAD without a protein on it and $18 was exorbitant for what I received.  While there wasn't a third service strike, the overall experience was hugely disappointing and not one to inspire me to return."
1,"Great people, great food, a fun place to go and they know you by name.  We spend a lot of time here, feels like Vegas used to be when the casinos went out of their way to make you feel welcome.  This place is recommended highly by both my wife and I.  Shout out to Sharon and Michelle, they both make us want to come back again and again."
0,"Mr Ramsay got greedy here... this is supposed to be an in-between for his 3 restaurants in Vegas but it's overpriced and unimpressive. I love BurGR and GR Steak but this place missed the mark for me and I can't say I was surprised based on the reviews. We had a friend that wanted to go though so we gave it a try. \n\nRoast beef sandwich - \""would you like a sandwich with those fries?\"" This is what they should ask when you order. The fries were impressive in both portion and taste and totally overshadowed the much less impressive roast beef sandwich. The caramelized onion au jus was awesome but they barely gave me enough for half of my already small sandwich. I ordered mine without the horseradish aioli as I'm not a fan of horseradish and honestly a good roast beef sandwich shouldn't need much else other than the au jus. The meat was good, not great and it was pretty much just lacking all around. At $18 I was quite disappointed. But again... fries... awesome. Had to ask for additional ketchup though as they brought out the smallest little half shot glass of ketchup lol\n\nWarm salty pretzels - 3 pretzel bread sticks for $8... umm... how about some free bread on the table? Isn't this pretty standard when you are paying for a nice meal?\n\nPEI Mussels & Clams - not my choice to order but I'm a fan of clams so I picked at it... and when I say picked at it.. I mean i had to literally pick at the plate to find the tiny bits of clam that had fallen out of all the shells. The chorizo was the best part of this dish and there was about 4 little slices of it.\n\nChicken Pot Pie - KC ordered this and enjoyed it but it was awfully small for $23. I took a bite and it had good flavor but the one she makes is better.\n\nOur friends ordered steak and caesar salad and seemed to enjoy it but felt like it was overpriced for the place.\n\nService was so-so... waitress was very friendly but made a few mistakes and forgot some things. She made up for it by comping the pretzels and I don't get too upset with mistakes as long as you are friendly and make an attempt to make up for it. \n\nNo ciroc at the bar?! Seriously... I just don't understand that. The place was packed though on a Friday night and I'm sure it will keep doing well with a great location inside Caesars Palace. Crazy tourists...."

0,"Worst place to go for medical care. Had me waiting for two hours for test results than when I finally get seen, I get the oh, we need to get the results faxed over here. So stupid. Don't ever go to any concentra. Pay doctors that care and know what's going on."
1,"I walked in guessing this would be a terrific burger, and I wasn't disappointed. Paul, my server, was quick, knowledgable, and kind. He suggested an awesome cocktail (skinny screw) that I had to restrain myself from drinking immediately. Ordered the Blue Burger with arugula- fabulous! It was simple, but every ingredient was fresh and delicious. Perfect amount of blue cheese and I love the buns they use. Great value for the $$."
1,"One of my favorite places in Vegas. I love the decor, the food, the service & their yummy drinks. This place hits the spot! The downside? the tables are WAY too close together! It makes things weird at times and some of the hostess are bitchy. Maybe their spanx is too tight? Maybe the loads of MAC makeup got in their eye. Whatever the reason is it's so not cute. But forget them and have a drink & a roll! ;)"
1,Affordable and delicious Greek food. Try it out as these guys deserve your business
0,I used to love this place but lately the spicy level is off. I order green curry spicy level 1 for delivery. It was so hot I couldn't eat it. I'd say it was spicy level 9. Very disappointed.
1,"I've been here three or four times, and in all those times I've only been disappointed by a single cupcake that seemed to be a bit too dry to have any real flavor. However, I can now say that that instance seems to be the exception rather than the rule. I always have to get a red velvet, and my new favorites after this holiday season are the salted caramel and pumpkin spice. It's like magic in my mouth.\n\nOne comment though - none of these workers ever forget to bring their enthusiasm to work. Normally I would list that comment as a compliment, but when the first thing I hear at 9:00 in the morning is \""OmG isn't life just MARvelous and OmG you are FLYING home today and you DON'T live here?! Well that's SO exciting and we will TOTALLY get you a bag that you can take your cupcakes in, OBviously\"" - let's just say it is a little overwhelming.\n\nAnd fair warning, you really need to love cupcakes to be willing to pay $22 for 6. But let's be serious, I'm definitely going again next week when I'm back in town :)"

1,Says they deliver on here... Wrong & wrong again & should not be checked! I like Applebee's & thought the delivery was something new for the Pittsburgh area... Don't know if this is something Yelp does or something someone checked off... But not cool!
0,"Waaaaaaaaay overrated. Here's the breakdown; half decent fries, very greasy burgers, sausages in a hot dog bun, and a handful of fatty mayo based dipping sauces. None of this is exceptional. And you WILL leave this poorly ventilated restaurant smelling like grease. that alone is enough to stay away."
0,Omg. This place is horrible. Long lines and unprofessional employees.  How do they mange to stay open. They are horrible.\nCustomer service is nonexistent here. \nDon't give your money to these people. Find another fabric store.

0,Yo! These noodles fuckin suck! Plate looked like homeless man vomit! Pass!
1,k...  Here is the deal.  I would give this place a 5 if I had never had east coast italian.  Fot italian food anywhere I think this is a great place though. Really cool decor. Loved the bar. Our bartender Frank was a really cool guy.  \n\nThe fact that this place is a cougar heaven makes it extra cool (Cougars need lovin too!)\n\nI think the best italian I have had in phoenix.  Had a spinach salad and bruschetta which was SO good.  Bruschetta was one of the best I have had anywhere.\n\nHad a Sausage and peppers in a red Cream Sauce.  Very very tasty.  Food was way better than I thought it would be.  \n\nJust might go for happy hour today because I am cravin the itailian and the cougar atmosphere is a good one.
0,"Terrible! \nI recently got a gel nail fill and hated it.\nThey can't do any designs, even the simplest ones.  I asked for colour tips with a small heart on my accent nail.  She said she didn't know how to do that after telling me she had been doing nails for 16 years. I ended up getting white tips with a full colour accent nail.  they use airbrush paint for white tips and got paint ALL OVER MY HANDS!\nThey didn't shape my nails properly, it was messy and when she actually used the gel colour for my accent nail, she got it all over my skin.\nI jumped from chair to chair and had to keep moving my stuff (i.e purse and shopping bags)\nMy nails also hurt for an entire day after I got them done.  \nIt was very cheap but that was the only positive thing i have to say about this place"
0,Meh is right. Came to this venue for the Sensation White Event and was horrified by the set up. The employees had no idea where anything was and nothing was labeled. Even the bars were tough to come across. Overall they really needed to step up their game considering tickets were going for @250 a piece.
0,"I would give this place negative stars but I'm not given that option. Actually, my preferred rating would be '1 Bulldozer', but that also is not an option, so here we go. 1 very undeserved star.\n\nWe were in town visiting a friend down the street and 4 of us stopped by here for lunch on the way to the Metro. There isn't much in the area, and this placed advertised a proprietary 'Copoli Burger' with some sort of optimism, so we thought we'd give it a try. After all, who can screw up a burger?\n\nThese guys. These guys can screw up a burger, and they can screw it up with painstaking efficiency and utter contempt. I asked about the 'Copoli sauce', which the server said was just a mixture of ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise or something like that. Since I'm a no-mayo kind of guy, I figured it wouldn't be too much to ask for just the standard ketchup/mustard on the burger. To the server it seemed like a standard no-hassle request. Awesome. I couldn't wait for this seemingly giant tasty-looking burger.\n\nWhat I received was a large burger almost spitefully slathered with mayonnaise. For some context here, there was only one other table in the place, and they already had their food., so the margin for error or confusion here is very narrow. The other burger recipient at the table received their standard burger with just a standard amount of mayonnaise. So I flag the server, who was super nice during all of this, and show her the burger. Without even looking at it she said there was no mayo on it, but I didn't even have to lift up the bun to show her this 'mysterious' white ooze coming out of it. She offers to take it back and bring me a new one. This is where things get downright offensive.\n\nThrough the corner of my eye I can see the cook (who I am pretty sure is the owner, and the father of our server) take the burger back to the counter and throw the bun in the garbage. Where is the rest of the burger? I wonder. Surely that would go in the garbage too. Nope! There he is, scraping away the mayonnaise with none other than paper towel. He is clearly oblivious that with a small restaraunt, what he is doing is visible to all the customers. Maybe he does realize it, and just doesn't care. Either way, I am brought what I am expected to believe is a new burger, and again, I didn't even have to take the bun off to ask what all the white stuff was still all over the bacon. He must have missed that with the paper towel. \n\nAt this point I refuse any further burgers and I can tell the server is pretty embarassed. The cook/owner/father at no point during all of this even attempts to make eye contact (we are like 10 feet away) or offers any glimpse of shame or even recognition of how messed up this is. I watch the rest of my friends finish eating their pepperoni pizza, which had been unexpectedly dusted in sesame seeds, and I left hungry.\n\nI'm not one for gentrification, but if someone bulldozed this place and put up a condo, I wouldn't be sad."
1,"The other worldly pleasure that is a meal at Bella Italia!\n\nI've eaten here quite a few times, and for an extremely busy restaurant, which also happens to be a chain, I'm repeatedly surprised by the quality of the food!\n\nBella Italia has two branches in Edinburgh, one at Northbridge, and my personal favourite at Hanover. Technically, there's no noticeable difference between the two branches; I'd even say the one at Northbridge looks nicer,  and has some pleasant outdoor seating for those few and cherished days when the sun shines in Edinburgh (jokes jokes...)\n\nFor some reason, I've repeatedly trekked all the way to Princes street, turned on to Hanover, and treated myself to the greatest pizzas and desserts! I've eaten here because I was bored, for a break from shopping, and then for my 19th birthday dinner! Service is great, and on one occasion, my pizza was diligently replaced (after I'd devoured half of it) when the waitress realized an ingredient was missing from my order. More pizza for me, so I wasn't complaining!\n\nI would definitely recommend Bella for just about every dining occasion; dinner with friends, a large group, a date.. and they're also very affordable. The banoffee pie should not go untasted! \n\nAs I've written this, I'm quite tempted to head back real soon; I even managed to score a free umbrella from a member of staff last December, so I definitely feel appreciated as well!"
1,"We LOVED this place! We had the tandoori chicken, tandoori mixed grill and naan. Everything was so flavorful we wanted to keep eating even though the portions are so big you shouldn't clean your plate. We went at dinner on a Wednesday night, so it was pretty empty, but the service was excellent. Maharani just became one of our favorites in Madison!"
0,"Burgers were not cooked as ordered...fries were just OK.....milkshakes were excellent...service was basically non-existent ....we sat at counter with view of kitchen and door to kitchen...everytime an employee entered/exited the kitchen we were exposed to total filth...dirty cloths on the floor, visible (clear) plastic garbage container that employees dumped drinks/uneaten food as they entered the kitchen....the health sector would go crazy and I can't believe this is what Mr. Flay envisioned when he opened this place...."
1,"A flaming preying mantis guards the Downtown Container Park, which is exactly what it sounds like: a playground park surrounded by stacked shipping containers housing a group of unique boutiques, shops, and restaurants you can't find elsewhere in the city.\n\nFood options include barbeque at Ern's, frozen treats and sweets at Sasa and SweetSpot, and gourmet twists on hotdogs, tacos, and popcorn. Most boutiques are geared toward women's fashion accessories, but there is also a toy store, a Disney art store, and a general store. \n\nPlenty of stores to explore, a playground for kids during the day and adults at night, and alcoholic beverages available around every corner and in every form, from draft beers at the hotdog stand to frozen spiked pops at the popsicle place.\nWorth a visit, lots of nooks to explore, a stage set up for live music, and free parking on Sundays."
0,"I would like to amend my review, since i wrote it from the first of two rooms that i stayed in at the LVH. My wife and daughter came from los angeles halfway into this business trip since she has family in the henderson area. I realized i couldn't expect my wife and child to stay in this room, so i went downstairs and asked if i could upgrade my room. When they answered that i was already in an upgraded room, i briefly died from choking back laughter, and then asked to be upgraded to a suite, which was an extra 55 dollars a night, and this was the experience:\n\nThere's no fridge, there was one in the cheaper room. The emergency exit sign is a laminated sheet of printer paper literally screwed into the wall. There appears to have been a shootout at some point in history based on the location of several large carpet stains located at the door, sliding window, corner, and foot of the bed. I thought someone was jackhammering outside the room until i found that the noise was coming from the air conditioner. The 3\"" of dust covering the air filter did little to dampen the sound. The shower was awesome, huge and had like 14 shower heads, which dispense either an arctic ice blast or hot magma straight from the center of the earth at your choosing. I left an expensive photo tripod in the room, on the middle of the bed, but the hotel and the lost and found never found it.\n\nThe staff were still helpful and friendly, and one of them now has a very nice tripod."
0,"Most experiences were fine, with the exception that they seemed a little inconsistent in their pricing. This was confirmed a few months ago when I dropped off a blue dress. My friend picked up the blue dress to borrow, wore it, returned it to be cleaned again. Pricing was an additional $5.00 the second time, for the exact same dress, no stains, nothing out of the ordinary. I showed the cashier my receipt from dropping off the dress the week before. No budge. Not even an effort to explain the pricing difference or an offer to honor the price. He just shrugged his shoulders and said he didn't know why the price was different. Unusual business ethic."
1,Food was good costumer service was even better. Just wish I would of been really hungry. Loved the cotton candy
0,"You'd think if they are going to charge folks around $16 for a simple tuna melt and onion rings, the service would be awesome.  Not the case. My fiance ordered a tuna melt and then decided he wanted to switch his side order to onion rings.  It took us more than 10 minutes and multiple requests to the hostess, bussers and other service to get the waitress to come by.  We asked for the switch and were told she had to see how far along the meal was.  Ridiculous.  It's pretty easy to switch macaroni salad to onion rings at any stage of preparation.  The food took a little while to arrive and when it did, they had not switched the side.  This took another 10 minutes or so to accomplish, causing the food to get cold.  Meanwhile, I asked for a side of ranch dressing and mustard, which also took multiple requests and about 15 minutes, so my food got cold too.  My water glass became empty as I ate and was not refilled until long after I was finished, even though I specifically asked a server for more water.  Our waitress never stopped by to check on us during the meal, and when she finally showed up she brought the check without offering coffee or dessert.  Meanwhile, I had already gotten up to ask to speak to a manager, who never came.  Only after I asked the waitress for a manager did she come.  The manager was nice and comp-ed our meal, which was the right thing to do.  Kudos to her for her professionalism.  Too bad it didn't extend to providing good service throughout the meal.  Food was just average - certainly not worth the inflated Vegas price.  This was a miserable experience certainly not worth it for a standard tuna melt."
0,Worst service! Ordered a hot fudge banana shake and instead got a Sunday. Instead of being nice about it the girl told me I ordered it wrong but she would remake it for me.

Similar value, just as fun, and a professional and courteous staff that respects their patrons and is interested in people having a good time."
1,"I saw Mystere summer of 2005, so I apologize for my review being so late, but I doubt the show has changed much since then.  Regardless if you pay $80-200 a ticket. Mystere is definitely a show worth every single penny. \n   Mystere's stage/theater is not as amazing as O, and the story for Mystere is definitely not up there with Ka.  However, what Mystere lacks in those areas it makes up with amazing acrobatics and gymnastics that Ka and O can't compete with.  Mystere's story (if there is one) is definitely more on the fun, circus-like kooky side of things. But it's  great time.\n  Mystere was my first ever Cirque show in Vegas, but it easily had me hooked.  I highly recommend Mystere for anyone regardless if you've seen another Cirque show or not.\n~G"

0,"Yuk! Yuk! Yuk!--First room had bugs, ring around the toilet, rust and a cracked tub. Second room was an upgrade but it was very dusty and there were blood stains around the jacuzzi. Couldn't run the jacuzzi because of a default that automatically turn the shower on. Oh, did I mention the hair and stains on the washcloths? Uber nasty!! \n\nThere's a huge language barrier with housekeeping and it's clear they only spot clean the rooms. Management doesn't care. You can really tell that the staff is there to get a paycheck and they don't care about making your experience a great one. The restaurants and nightlife are the only thing that's happening for the Stratosphere. With so many bad reviews for this and other hotels in Las Vegas, it's becoming clear that Vegas is going downhill. It definitely isn't the same from 4 years ago and beyond. I hardly saw people gambling at this hotel. Really? I think it's time for other cities like Atlanta to create a little Las Vegas. You'll get much better service, better recourse for problems that you may incur and an overall better experience!!"
0,"Hmm... I'm not sure what I was expecting from my first taste of Native American food but, my Navajo Taco from The Fry Bread House was did not live up to any ideas I had.  The fry bread is good enough... of course, anything you deep fry is usually tasty but, the taco was super bland and nothing interesting.  It basically was fried bread with lettuce, beans and some cheese slapped in it.  :-/\n\nWhen I add the lackluster food to the fact that the man at the counter was not friendly at all... rude actually, I don't have a very satisfied feeling about my experience.  My friend was trying to order the stew and some fry bread and the man treated him like he was dumb for not knowing that you have to order a combo to get both.  Then, when we ask what drinks they had, the man kinda rolled his eyes and pointed to a sign... again, like we should have already know where the sign was or what their options were.  Really?  We walked in and right up to the counter so we didn't have much chance to familiarize ourselves with their exact set-up.  I almost said something but, didn't want any chance of retaliation in our food. \n\nSo, my friends stew was full of flavor and my taco had none.  The only saving factor was the dessert fry bread at the end... \n\nI'd go back to try other things if friends invited me again but, I might try to find a different fry bread location since the big guy behind the counter was so rude and condescending at this one.  \n\nProlly won't see ya there."
1,"I like Cracker Barrel. Well...at least this one. I've never been to any other location. \n\nNo, the food isn't great (at least the lunch/dinner options), but it's not bad. It's been awhile since I've been here for breakfast, but if I recall that stuff is actually quite good (and cheap).\n\nMy dad freakin' LOVES this place. We came here for his birthday dinner recently so that's what I'm basing this review on. I got fried chicken and it came with two sides. The fried chicken was actually quite good. It was crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and nice & hot. Cracker Barrel gives you several different side options w/there meals (like, around 10). I had the hash brown casserole thingy, which is also a side they serve with breakfast meals. It's yummy! Basically, it's cheesy hash browns. I also got turnip greens. They were OK, but not great. They were kind of watery & lukewarm. I get the impression most of the sides at Cracker Barrel are cooked well in advance and just sit around most of the day. I also think turnip greens are most likely an unpopular side, and therefore probably sit around longer, without a fresh batch getting made.  I also had some lemonade to drink. It's basically liquid diabetes, which also means it's delicious! \n\nThis place is ALWAYS packed (on the weekends anyway). This was the first time I've been here since moving back to AZ in June, but it's not for lack of trying. I've tried to stop in w/my parents a few times over the past few months, but the wait was ridiculous (this past time we waited 20 minutes for a table, which really wasn't all that bad). Cracker Barrel has a gift shop set up as you wait where they sell overpriced country/southern novelties.\n\nService was fine & the food here is VERY affordable. I probably wouldn't choose this place, but I don't mind coming here at all w/my dad who like I said, LOVES this place."
1,"The guys at Empire are really awesome people. They were so friendly and really fun to be around in general. Paul, the guy who did my piercings, knew bis stuff.

I will absolutely be going back."

1,"\""So, Stephy, what do you feel like eating for dinner tonight?\""\n\n\""Cozy!\""\n\n\""Is Cozy a cuisine?\""\n\nIt is at Richardson's. Wow, talk about walking into a place and instantly feeling welcome, warm, cozy and yummy. Now let it be said, right here and now, that the whole \""New Messico\"" food is not really up my alley. Tex Mex, do they call it? Newp, not my thing at all, but good hearty comfort food on a chilly night always sounds good and so we ventured on over to Richardson's to see what they were cooking up.\n\nBut first...wine. (You can't order food without wine, duh.)\n\nSo, we ordered a tasty bottle of Chilean red (imagine that, me, order a spicy red, nooo!!) and as the four of us waited for our table we looked over the menu and read the many specials up on the boards. Fish seemed to be the hot dish of the night, but once I saw one of my favorite words....SCALLOPS...it was kind of a no brainer as to what I was gonna order.\n\nWe then were seated in a super cozy booth in the back and after the four of us devoured the pizza app we ordered it was time to order the main attractions. The boys had Chimayo chicken and the carne adovada and Gabi K and I tried the scallop appetizer and the special scallop pasta. Sadly this is where the review goes south...\n\nSALT. There's a reason you often hear the word \""pinch\"" next to \""salt.\"" If it's over done, yikes, it's just gross and their blackened coating is like a salt lick. Which was sucha  bummer, because those scallops were cooked to perfection, but after attempting to scrape off the blackening on 4 of them, I finally just gave up. Perhaps the way to go is to just ask for them grilled. I think they would be superb then, but stay away from the salty blackened option.\n\nOther than that minor thing, I really enjoyed our experience here. The waiter was a great sport considering we had two comedians with us and put up with all of our silliness. The only other thing was the check sitch. I guess they don't like to split a check more than 2 ways. Eventually they split ours 3 ways after persisting, so i might suggest asking ahead of time if they can split the bill if you are planning on anymore than two cards.\n\n:)"
0,"Many douche bags and old cougars. At least the night I was there.\nDrinks were alright and strong. Food was decent. My tab wasn't too bad.\n\nI was wearing my Marine Corps hoodie there on the Marine Corps birthday/veterans day weekend, told I couldn't have the hood on, because it's against policy. Despite it being cold and raining and the propane heater we were next to kept going out.\nEvery waitress was wearing their hoods. Not exactly fair is it?\n\nMy wife was cold, she wore my sweater with the hood on. That's ok because she's cute.\n\nA bathroom attendant, only in the men's bathroom. No thanks.\n\nBought a water to take with me when the night was over. Wasn't allowed to leave with my water. Had to throw it away. Brand new bottle of water with just a sip out of it."

0,"Came her during lunch. We came with 5 people and was expecting a quick lunch. The sandwiches didn't come out until 45 minutes later with each persons sandwich coming out every 5 minutes. \n\nI got the godfather, and it was a little greasy and salty. The curly fries weren't bad since it just came off the fryer. \n\nOverall, if you had nothing to do and could wait an hour for subpar sandwich, I would rate it a 5. Otherwise, I rate it a 1 star. We won't be coming back, especially for lunch."
0,"I don't even want to give this one star... the staff at the front desk was less than courteous.  the walls in the rooms are cement blocks, makes you feel like you're in prison.. there was candy smeared all over the floors, and popcorn not even vacuumed up.  the dust on top of the TV was so thick I wrote \""wash me\"" on it.  The air conditioning would not stay on... It smelled in there.. DO NOT stay here. Yes, it was cheap, but spend a couple extra bucks and get a real hotel room!"
0,"We were SO disappointed .. Tonight was our 40th & we were in Scottsdale & everyone recommended Cafe Monarch.. Tables too close.. A real\""routine\"" .. Our amuse buche was  deposited.. No wine.. No sign of wine.. Its all a process & we are not into process for a foodie dinner. We left before any more process occurred.."
1,"I've only been here once, but I will definitely go back. It was a while back but I had been searching the area for something  more in the lines of comfort foods. After googling and searching yelp, I read a few reviews and looked over their menu. It sounded like it was close to what I was looking for so I  headed over after work. \n\nFood - I got an open face roast beef sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy, as well as, some chicken noodle soup. The soup was pretty good, but the best part was the HUGE plate of roast beef and mashed potatoes. They were the warm, yummy comforting food I was in a search for that day. I totally left happy. \n\nService - It was just a touch slow but the kid was pretty friendly and brought things out in a fairly quick manner. The only reason it was slow was that he was the ONLY person there and there were quite a few tables. I tried to be patient as I've been there and it kinda is hard.\n\nI know this is a jewish deli so I totally need to go in for bagels one day, but I haven't had the time or thought. It's hard to find a place in the city with any semblance of comfort food so this place is a good alternative when I'm wanting mashed potatoes and warm yummy goodness. It's not the plate lunch places of the South, but it's a good substitution."
1,"I have no complaints. Quick service, predictable prices. Sat at the bar, ordered the Western Burger (thumbs up) with tater tots. Was in and out in under 40 minutes."
0,"Eh.  I'm sorry Jim Gould's, I think you've changed and not for the better. \n\nWent for our anniversary dinner last night, and despite having a loud and obnoxious group of drunk out-of-town conference attendees trying to impress one another with their wit and cleavage seated right next to us, figured that the food, wine, and service would compensate.  It didn't.  At half-price, the glass of shiraz I had was overpriced, and slightly chilled. My kobe beef burger was bland and not particularly tender.  The brie on top was flavorless.  Pommes frites were good, though I'm fairly confident they were not \""truffle oil misted\"" as described.  But still, yay pommes frites.  My husband's beef medallion \""special\"" was itty bitty and overcooked.  Also, despite being described as a special, was listed on the regular menu, and for the price that we were charged.  So, neither the dish nor the price were \""special\"". \n\nWhich brings me to the strange service: when we made a remark about the odd \""$1 wine shot\"" feature (seriously? a shot of wine?  served in a shot glass?), the waiter replied \""yeah, well, we're trying to compete with KoFusions $1 sushi.  They're really busy over there and we don't get many people on Mondays\""; later, we overheard another waiter tell a customer \""well, we've changed our menu.  We don't have specials anymore.  Our specials are just things on the regular menu that we want people to order.\""  And, though our service was courteous, it was slow but harried, despite the relative non-busyness of the restuarant.\n\nIt's too bad.  I used to quite enjoy Jim Gould's, but we're not likely to be in any hurry to go back."
1,Boulder Hwy location is our favorite!!! Best food and the waitresses are the sweetest. Love the breads and the way they cook their eggs!
1,"My son's had a great time. The place is not too big where it would be hard to keep track of your kid(s) and it's not too small where you would feel like you are packed in there like sardines. Fortunately, we got there early in the morning when there were not many people there. My boys enjoyed all the playhouses, toys, cars, and train table. I will definitely be taking them back there for more fun times."

0,"Maybe the most disorganized store I have ever seen. Now, add that in with trying to bring my dog with me into this store...Pure Chaos. \n\nMy last visit (of many I've made to this PetSmart) made me realize that I'm better off heading to either Fleet Farm or Tabby and Jacks to get whatever I may be looking at locally for my dog.  \n\nI enjoy the fact I can walk my dog into the store to get what I need, but when I head to the footwear isle to find nothing for medium to large dog sizes I get a little irritated. \nDo the employee's working here know how to stock the shelves? Why are all the socks and footwear thrown all over the bottom shelf of the clothing isle? \n\nNot everyone has a 10 lb dog. I'm not even asking much. I have a 48 lb English Bulldog and I still could not find anything in his size. \n\nThe last thing I want to do is sift through items thrown all over the floor and shelf. Forget it! \n\nI asked a employee if they carried socks for medium to large size dogs  (their website says this store does have these items in stock) and instead of even helping me sift through their ridiculous isle I was told, \""What you see if what we have\"". \nCome on Man!!!!! Really? Is this your best customer service?\n\nNot sure If you will be seeing much more of me and my Bully anytime soon coming back in here."
0,"I came here with some friends, and was utterly disappointed. I ordered the fajitas, and the meat was limited. I had 15 pitas but 8 pieces of meat, a little cup of guacamole, and lots of onions. What is that? \n\nThe service was slow, it took 10 minutes for the waiter to collect payment, but took less then a minute to bring the bill."
1,"**********TACO TUESDAY*********\n\nMy first ever Taco Tuesday was here.  Went with a LOT of rowdy people and the place was seemingly cool with the huge loud crowd, and even was able to seat us (I'm talking like 50 people).\n\nI got a meal #27, don't remember exactly what it was but it included tacos and beans and was pretty epic-tasting.  The meal combo seemed so perfect that all of my friends got the #27 and loved it just as much.  However, my friend Greg did not get the #27 and was temporarily shunned for doing so. \n\nThe chips are epic, as was the salsa and the interior decor.  \n\nAlso epic are their margaritas (and from what I remember, cheap too).  There is a seperate bar area you can go to get away from your crowd and order drinks.  Bar is especially cool because there are pictures of el guapo and wooden ships to look at while you order/drink.  \n\nCabs were ready and willing to take us back to the strip after we were finished eating.  I rode with chuckyhacks and it was fun.\n\nWOULD GO AGAIN, HAD A BLAST, 11/10 STARS."
1,"Barefoot Sanctuary is a place where I can call home when I want to relax, and be myself, away from the hustle of the city, life! It's my sanctuary, and a place for me to come together with great new friends. It's a community within Whole Foods, a totally unique place to have a yoga studio! Can't resist the muffins on the way out..."

Has chorizo , avocado, tomato, with a sauce.. This was amazing!! Potatoes were perfect. I brought the kiddos as well, French toast and chicken fingers .. Amazing.. Great price, great for the family! Service was just as good as the food!!"

0,"Meh...I thought it was just okay.  I appreciate that they delivered as far away as we are (near west side, north of Beltline). Prices were typical of what I would expect, about $9-$12 for a typical entr\u00e9e, so not terribly expensive.  The PuPu Platter appetizer was pretty good and came with a lot of variety.  The Pork Fried Rice was just okay...nothing special, but not bad.  And finally, the sesame chicken was just not good.  The pieces seemed to be a lot more breading that was VERY crunchy than actual chicken...in fact I'd say that it was just chicken trimmings.  Disappointing.  Probably won't order from them again."
0,"No. Just, no. \n\nWe went on a slow day and had no idea what we were in for. Our server was nonexistent for the first 30 minutes, when she finally did show she took another 30 to get our beers. Did I mention the place was 1/4 full? Ridiculous. The coronas were 4 bucks which is crazy when you can walk over to Dos and get them for $2.50. The tables around us were also complaining at the lack of attention. The food here is bland at best. Just don't do it."
0,"This is purely a car wash review, as I have never been inside the convenience store.\n\nThe car wash is fine, but the high-pressure sales tactics they implemented at this and the Rampart location have left me and my husband with a very bad taste in our mouths.  We go to Fab Freddy's because they are water-saving car washes.  We just want the least expensive exterior wash, and have been made to feel extremely guilty for not getting the full detail.  When we reply that we want the $7.99 wash, they act like it isn't an option.  And no, I am no interested in their \""discount\"" card, where you have to give them your personal information in order to save a few cents off your gas with a wash.\n\nNo thanks!!  They are going to lose customers if they don't back off."

0,"I had previously reviewed the MGM Grand in Las Vegas and gave it four stars. Well, after staying there for five nights and experiencing all the bullshit we went through, it got dropped down to two stars. And that's ONLY because the staff there was friendly.\n\nSo we lock in the rate of $50 per night in February to travel in May. We book a king bed. When we get there--\""we're all out of king beds, we can upgrade you into the west wing for no charge. But a lot of people don't like the west wing, so if you don't like it, we can move you guys tomorrow.\"" Okay fine, we go to the west wing..even though I've been told by many people the West Wing rooms are shitty. So we get to the room, it's a dingy piece of crap. You walk in and literally walk right into the bathroom. Plus the room is SMALL!  \n\nSo the next day, we call the front desk. They say we can move between 2 and 4pm. So I check back at 2 they tell me to check back at 3:30. I call back at 3:30, \""okay we can move you to a king room (WHICH IS WHAT WE ORIGINALLY RESERVED!)--however it will be an hour before a bellhop can get your bags.\"" Are you f'ing kidding me!??! An hour!!?? Christ, I know the hotel is big, but still! We wound up carrying our bags from the West Wing to the front desk. Anyone who has stayed there knows that's a long freaking walk!  We complained to the front desk and told them at this point, we'd rather be staying at South Point (where we usually stay.) They got a manager and upgraded us to a suite.\n\nSo we get to the new room, turn the A/C on full blast and head out for our anniversary dinner at the fabulous T-Bones Steak House in Red Rock (read my review for that!)  We get back to the room around 11:00pm and it feels like we walked into a goddamn sauna! I call the front desk to let them know our A/C is not working. Okay,  we'll have someone right up. Couldn't give me a time frame. So now it's midnight, we're both tired so we call back and tell them to forget about it. Unbelievable. The A/C works, but it worked half-assed. The TV sucked as well, they're not HD TV's and the picture was very fuzzy. Also, our room safe was competely useless since the battery on it was low, so we couldn't use it. We also had no Do Not Disturb thing for the door, so I made one myself. If I called the front desk to ask for any of these things to be fixed, I'd probably be still waiting.\n\nOh it gets better. The kicker was the next night when we get into the elevator. There are like four people on the elevator, we are on the 11th floor. The four other people get off at 6. The elevator goes to 10 and then DROPS two floors. My wife and I had our lives flashing before our eyes. The elevator made a creaking noise and just dropped! Reminded me of the old Edge at Six Flags Great America.\n\nWe went to the Rainforest Cafe here one night, it was ok, nothing special. The lines for the breakfast and dinner buffets were absolutely ridiculous. We waited over 30 minutes for breakfast on a Tuesday morning and over 45 minutes for dinner on a Monday night. On Friday, we went to the Rio Buffet (The best I've ever had, again read my review for that) and waited all of 2 MINUTES. Take that! \n\nAgain, I only gave this place two stars because the employees are very friendly especially the dealers in the poker room. Stay away from here. Go to South Point instead."
1,Super clean!!!
0,"I agree it's over-priced. Also over-rated and poor customer service. \nWe were very excited about going to this restaurant and waiting for it to open. Bit of a let down. \n\nFood was ok. We had the Chicken Saltado, Aj\u00ed de Gallina & Chicha Morada (a drink). The drink I liked more than the food - it tasted like sugar cane juice. Measly serving. Loud music, exotic ambience and Peruvian scenaries on TV screens. Seating not bad.\n\n The waiter was over-enthusiastic when we were first seated & there were not so many people in the restaurant. Every time we said thank you, he would say - No Thank you!! I was tempted to say - oh no Thank you and so on :) It had a Sienfeld episode type of potential! Not saying this in a bad way. Really thought it was funny, until 3 or more groups came trickling in and this one person was taking orders, serving and even making/shaking cocktails. The guy was literally zipping around like a jack rabbit trying to cope and I could see the stress. We waited for what seemed like ages for our check and finally I decided to go get the check myself (you guessed right - he was also the cashier!!!!). He did not look too happy that I came up to ask for the check and with a frown, slapped the bill on the table. I paid and turned to leave.. No thank you or any other nicety you may be used to hearing in most restaurants in this pricey Scottsdale neighbourhood. \n\nNot worth it! For the price and small portions they should be able to afford more waiters. And this was a Friday evening. I wish them luck. It is a mom & pop kind of place and I hate to see more of those disappear."
1,Great atmosphere and the service was excellent.  The food and drinks were excellent.  Great spot to go to for happy hour.

1,"We made it a point to go to Mandalay specifically for Burger Bar since the reviews are so spectacular.  \n\nThe food was fantastic, the service was fantastic, and it was the only place in Mandalay packed at 12 in the afternoon.  That speaks for itself.  My only gripe is that they didn't have any beer or drink specials.  That's pretty lame.  I thought it would be more chic for some reason.   Other than that, Burger Bar met the expectation.  I'll be hitting them up EVERY TRIP!"
0,"27 lanes to check out but only 3 - 4 at any given time, manned by people who have poor attitudes. I've been here 8 times in two weeks out of necessity because I just moved here and my household goods haven't arrived yet. Every time I go to check out, the cashiers just give a grunt to acknowledge you and the ones working the floor don't even stop when you ask a question."
1,"LOVED THIS SHOW! Funny, fun, great actors/singers/dancers.  Yes, it can be crude, but it's Vegas, people!  Everything has a little extra crude factor in Vegas.  There were a few kids in front of us, and I felt really uncomfortable for their parents.  Kids do not belong in Vegas under any circumstances, jeez.  Anyway, the show was hilarious, very well done, our entire group of 12 girls loved it.  All of the seats are great. Wear 80s gear and they might upgrade your seat.  Definitely go to this show!"
1,Great location and great food. I recommend the Kale Chicken Caesar in a wrap and the Kale Cleanse juice.
1,Live music was really good. Food was tasty. I mean besides all the other stuff Vegas offered this was a good stop on the way out for an evening on the strip.
0,Bourbon Steak House- was fantastic\n\nProperty not well maintained \n\nThe property staff and service is deplorable --- STAY AWAY
0,What kind of customer facing company doesn't allow you to speak to a person to complain? Somehow they managed to lose our bag in Chicago when we didn't even change planes there. We didn't even know we had to stop in Chicago until we got on the flight thanks to a very disinterested ticketing agent. And they didn't even offer to pay the $25 fee that we had to pay to get it to our final destination in the first place. You have to send an email and forms for them to even review to credit anything. The only saving grace was an associate that got permission for my boyfriend to buy a jacket since we were in Boston with just a tee shirt. And we still have to send in the receipts and a form to get that back. Overall one of the worst experiences I've ever had.

0,"We located this brand new spot in LV a couple weeks ago whilst attempting to find a spot to have lunch. My brother and I were traipsing all over the Palazzo and I had decided to take him to lunch at First Food & Bar upstairs. Unfortunately some changes must have been made at First because they routed us downstairs to Rattlecan, stating that the menu was by the same chef and so would be similar. \n\nWell - yes and no. For starters, Rattlecan is kind of synonymous with everything that I hate about the cheesiest parts of Las Vegas. Garrish, loud decor spills out from around every corner and pops out of every wall. The Urban Daddy piece written about RC describes it as \""This feels like a place where Axl Rose would have started a fight on the Appetite for Destruction tour,\"" but my response to that is \""Not hardly.\"" \n\nFor one the menu is priced way to high for anybody on the Appetite for Destruction tour. For too, I doubt Axl Rose would have ventured past the entrance to the restaurant after casting his eye inward. \n\nAnyway...the food, which is REALLY what this is about. We had the Pastrami Sandwich and Mini Wagyu Burgers. \n\nThe Pastrami sandwich was very serviceable, along with the mini Wagyu sliders, although, I seriously doubt that the sliders were made with real Wagyu. Tasted like burger meat to me. \n\nUnfortunately I'm going to have to pass on this experience and I can't really recommend it to others. The food was decent, and the service was good too, but at the end of the day there are just tons and tons of better choices to be made in Las Vegas. At the price point these guys are charging you are better off venturing elsewhere, such as First Food & Bar or even a lower end steakhouse for their bar menu."
1,"So this place has been open for a while, but I just recently discovered it. It was very delicious! David Wong is the owner of this place and he has done an amazing job. The interior design of the restaurant is very nice and the menu is very large with lots of options. The Malaysian Roti was made to the right texture and it was super delicious. The Chicken Satay was so moist and perfect! The Mango Salad is the best here, they are not stingy. The Filet Mignon Noodle Soup was really good because the meat was very soft. The Pad Thai was not my favorite though, I was actually disappointed, it's not bad, but it didn't stand out to me. Lastly we had Fried Banana w/ Ice Cream, and I didn't like it because there was coconut flakes in it and they use plantains and so it wasn't very tasty, I like it sweeter. But it was okay because David gave me extra fried banana because he said I was too skinny, haha! Overall, this place is a really good thai restaurant. I wonder why not that many people know about it. I will be coming back often:)"

0,":( The service was fast. We ordered (2) meals. The Bouillabaisse seafood soup and the Bavette Steak with Brussels sprouts. The french onion soup was excellent. The soup was ok; it would have been nice to see some seafood in it for it was little. The Bavette Steak was awful. There were (5) strips of tough meat and the sprouts were burned; maybe they were trying cajun. Don't know, but it wasn't worth $17.50 :("

0,"After hearing so many good things about Naakiti, I was excited to use them for our Wedding Day. Unfortunately that was the worst decision I could've made. :( The flowers arrived looking wilted and poorly put together. What was supposed to be purple roses were a definite wilted and odd pink. The boys were not at all helped with their boutonnieres which were also poorly made and falling apart as they walked the aisle. My husbands \""maile lei\"" was not at all at maile lei. The spray arrangement we ordered for our archway was never put up, but instead places onto a table. To top it off it has taken me two months to finally speak to the owner Randi who argued about their policy instead of understanding the lack from her staff. The overall experience was very unprofessional and I would not recommend Naakiti florists to anyone looking for quality or even a little professionalism. Brides, stay far away!"
1,"Prices had increased a little, from when they first opened.  But the shakes and juice mixes are really fresh and tasty.  The guy behind the counter, the manager I think would make interesting concoctions, they made something called morning dew one afternoon, with like mint leaves and some other ingredients that was left to bake in the sun.  I had a slice of their really nice pomegranate chocolate cake and it made my day :)  Its next to Trader's Joe and is near the Ahwatukee area, so it attracts a nice variety of people, ranging from young sporty types, to family spillover from shopping from trader joe's, to groups of friends catching up.\n\nI don't know how good the food is, but most of the people who came seem to like it.  I think if you are looking for a nice play to chill and have a cold refreshing juice or shake and catch up, this would be a nice place to go."
0,"A year later, prices have increased 70% and the quality of food have declined. Customer service is still superb though. Today, I ordered a pad-see-yew with beef level 5 - was made in an old pan with burnt scraps, 25% beef in dish only, there were clumps of chili not blended in the dish, and was drenched in oil. Another dish, red curry with chicken, was always lacking chicken pieces, they've increased prices and cut back on portions and quality, which happens quite often to good restaurants gone bad. Sad to say, this used to be my favorite place, but now we will never return and we are currently looking for another Thai place to be our go-to."
0,"My first visit was last night with a friend, and we experienced terrible service. I'm not a big complainer or full of difficult requests as I worked in the industry for 5 years, but this was bad.  After we were sat and given menus, we were basically deserted. We had already picked what we wanted to order for dinner yet hadn't even been brought waters yet. We had to walk to the bar to ask if anyone was going to come serve us at the table.\n\nFinally were able to order and the food was pretty good. Our server checked on us right after we got our food and then never again. We had to walk to the bar again to ask for boxes and our bill. Both of our water glasses had been empty half the meal. \n\nI'm not sure what was going on, but I'm hesitant to go back after this experience. We tipped 15% which was not even remotely close to being deserved, but as I mentioned I've worked in the industry and don't believe in stiffing people. Normally I would never tip below 20%+. If I'd had more time I would have asked to speak to a manager."

0,"I live very close to North End Pizza. I am a vegetarian, but however i try to stay away from dairy. We eat pizza a couple times a month and i was reading the great reviews so had to try it. We felt like we were ripped off. We got a large cheese pizza and the crust was great. Fast forward it was overpriced and there was very lite sause  and like no cheese on it. It was pathetic. My wife is a two slice person at most and two of their slices was not even as filling as one slice of pizza at Marc Rich's or Broadway where we normally go. The pie was insulting and stingy. I don't know how people can rave about this pizza. It was like bread with good taste. Skip this place if you like cheese on your pizza. RIP OFF......."
1,Loved it. Best place I went to in Vegas. Staff were so friendly and super relaxed. Bloody Mary with jalape\u00f1o stuffed olives wins every time. We went 3 times in 6 days. Can you say obsessed? Man vs food challenge was delicious. It's a Benedict but by the looks of it you have to dig for the eggs. The sauce is out of this world. One day I had the salmon scramble and it was awesome. Every thing we ordered was massive and could have been a man vs food challenge. I learned there's a hash house close to us in CT which means we are headed there ASAP. Yes you have to wait but it's so unbelievably worth it.
0,"If you really, really, really need to organize a group Karaoke session in Las Vegas, can't find another place to host it and your own home will not do, Xo Karaoke Room can service your needs.  However, be prepared for a very spartan, very weird and very alcohol-free evening.\n\nWhen you get to this place be prepared to have some initial trepidation about going in because the whole place has black-out windows similar to what you see at \""massage\"" parlors.  I was half wondering if we were going to get mugged going into this place.\n\nUpon entry you will probably go from scared to underwhelmed as it kind of looks like a vet office inside.  There is pretty much no attention to anything resembling feng shui,  aesthetics or interior design in this place - it's 100% functional.  The private rooms basically have the Standard Issue Korean Karaoke box + mic, a TV, a table and a wrap around sofa.  That's it.  The song selection is also standard for those boxes - I love how \""Perfect Day\"" by Lou Reed is always included and I always make sure to select it because the delta between the miserable domestic ennui in that song and the youthful melodrama of the Korean music videos is always L-O-L to me (probably only to me but hey, if you're going to make me endure the soulless, mind-numbing blight on our culture that is Katy Perry you're going to get some freakin' ice cold existentialism in return!) \n\nI had some Soju which was basically very sweet Sprite with about 0,01% alcohol content.  Seriously, I went through two bottles of it and didn't feel anything approximating a buzz (although I did start to have a sour stomach from all the high fructose corn syrup in those drinks!)\n\nNot recommended unless you're having a Karaoke emergency in which case set your expectations for uhhhhhhhh."
1,Der Ritter ist f\u00fcr mich in Sachen ital. Pizza das ma\u00df der Dinge in Karlsruhe. Donnerstags lohnt es sich immer f\u00fcr 6EUR je Pizza. Da ich immer bisher mitgenommen habe kann ich den Service nicht bewerten nur die Pizza und die ist TOP.\nImmer wieder sehr gerne
0,"The brewed coffee is okay, depending on the roast. The espresso drinks are disgusting. Their \""house blend\"" used for their espresso drinks is WAYYY too roasted. Honestly, I think they scorch their coffee beans that they use for their espresso drinks. Additionally, they don't rinse the espresso spoons so each drink has burnt espresso residue.  ALSO, their chai is fucking horrible. Worst chai I think I have ever tasted in my life. I basically payed 4.75 for iced milk. Not strong at all. If I want espresso drinks, I usually go to Citizen or Grinders. \n\nTheir food is pretty pricey as well and their portion sizes are pretty small. 10 dollars for an overdressed salad? No thank you. \n\n\nOther than that, if you can over their hipster vibe and the non prescription glasses (which is fucking annoying, did you not graduate from high school???) , the atmosphere is great to crank out homework and it's the only coffee shop that's open late in Central Phoenix. \n\nI'm not old enough to drink at their bar yet, but from what I've seen, it looks pretty nice and they have a variety of alcohol. \n\nOh and the brown haired girl, I think her name is Sasha, looks pissed off all the time(she is pretty hot though) And the tall white guy, I think his name is Sammy, is pretty bi-polar. Sometimes he is nice; other times he's an asshole."
1,"Long wait, but great food.\nI can't hold a grudge on our wait time, since I was one in a group of ten. We waited about 45 minutes and I will just consider that fair for a place that packed. \nThe food was simple, tastey, and so filling. Only one of our our ten finished a meal completely.\nAlso, booze in the morning with no judgement... which is nice."
1,"I found Lynn through Yelp a few months back and decided to book her because of the positive reviews and the convenience to my house.  I had no idea that I was about to develop an addiction to great nails!\n\nLynn and Dawn @ LUNL are true professionals.  They specialize creative gel nail designs for both fingers and toes.  They also offer traditional polish.  LUNL has gorgeous glitters and Lynn is consistently creating brand new glitter blends and ideas to dress up your nails.  I visit Lynn for my gel nails every 2 weeks.  Since I've been a customer I have received constant compliments on Lynn's glitters and nail artistry.  \n\nYesterday I visited Dawn for the first time for a pedicure.  She used a peppermint foot mask as part of the pedi that gave my feet a happy tingle for hours after I left the salon.\n\nThey always try to have fresh new movies or fun shows for you to watch while you get your mani or pedi.  On my first visit, I was a little confused on how to find LUNL in Studio Salons.  Studio Salon suites is located on the 2nd floor between Hooters and Grimaldi's on S. Rainbow.  Once you get upstairs, just go straight to the end of the hall and LUNL will be the first door to the right.  If you get confused, just give them a call."
1,"I used to live across the way so i ate there a lot.  I'm basing my review on the fact its mixed of all the times I've eaten there... I only had one meal which was very lemony and very salty and ... it was during happy hour, and the waitress brought new and also didn't charge me.  \nGET THE ROASTED VEGETABLES.  AMAZING.  I beg for the dressing recipe everytime I go.  They also have a salad with corn in it which will last for three days its so big.  \nmy girlfriend gets salmon everytime and says its the best in the valley.  Shes well traveled.\nLOVE THIS PLACE, it gets hoppin on fridays and especially on first friday."
1,"Delicious desserts! So many yummy looking cakes, so little money hahahha\n\nI got their Dark Chocolate Mousse with chocolate cream and chocolate glaze. Cost me $7. Not cheap, but hella good and hella worth it! Love the chocolate combination...it was rich and thick just the way I like it! My friend ordered one of the savory crepes. It was OK- I'm more of a sweets person."
0,"You guys. I hate giving bad reviews, I really do. My mom always said that if I can't say something nice, I shouldn't say anything at all. But that's not really the point of Yelp, now is it?\n\nHere's the sitch. I had a very small wedding in May, and I heard amazing things about White House, so I decided to go there for my personal flowers for the wedding party. This included bouquets for the ladies and boutonnieres for all the bros. \n\nAt my consultation with White House, I brought photos of the succulent bouquets I had in mind, and asked them to recreate the bouquets in the photo. I was VERY clear that they should use the same flowers--even going as far as to provide the name of the succulents I wanted--and the same color palette as featured in the photo. I asked several times if they felt they could do that, and I was assured that they definitely could. I left our meeting feeling completely confident that my expectations would be met. \n\nFast forward to my wedding day. White House dropped off my personal flowers, and for a moment, I thought there had been a mix-up. Surely they accidentally dropped off the wrong bouquet. The succulents were not the kind I had asked for (by specific plant name) and the colors were totally wrong. Instead of having a bouquet made of chicks and hens in soft minty greens and light lavenders, highlighted by soft peach roses, I received a horrific bouquet that looked like it would have fit right in at a clown's wedding. There was bright purple. There was a weird color green flower that did not complement the ugly bright purple. There were red roses. Let me repeat: red roses. \n\nAnd, since they dropped off the flowers with the front desk of the hotel only five minutes before we were scheduled for photos, instead of dropping them off with me in my suite, I had no one to voice my concerns to. On my wedding day, I had to do the best I could to fix my bouquet, and that is something no bride should have to deal with. \n\nNow, every time I look at photos from my wedding day, I am reminded of the TERRIBLE job White House did. I'm just glad I didn't have them handle my centerpieces. This place is a disaster. \n\nOh, it would be unfair if i didn't mention that they did a fine job on the boutonnieres. Those looked exactly like the boutonnieres in the photo I provided."
1,"I had the  Pha Nan curry with chicken, and it was AMAZING.  The dish was $8.75 and I took half of it home to eat the next day. \n\nWe come here once a week to treat ourselves to Thai tea. So, so good.\n\nStaff is always very sweet.\nI recommend this place to everyone."
0,"Pasta: over-cooked Lasagna, drenched in Cheese, no Bechamel.\nPizza: dough and sauce okay, way too much cheese, boring\n\nService: unattentive old man. \nAtmosphere: Vinyl tablecloth, tacky deco, could be in the Bronx\n\nNo reason to ever go back."
0,"Unfortunately, my experience was much similar to Mark's. The staff was indeed friendly, but entirely unequipped to provide proper attention to a patient's individual needs. My therapist, Melissa, was nice, but after the initial assessment she failed to explain in any detail the source of my pain, where it might have come from or illustrate a course of action. Instead, I was handed a sheet of exercises that looked like I could have printed it off of Google.\n\nMelissa often had more than one patient scheduled during our appointments. I would arrive, and she would have me work on a machine while she saw to someone else. On multiple occasions I would spend entire minutes sitting, motionless, waiting for Melissa to come back and instruct me. This is \""treatment\"" - time that I was billed for! This did not seem to be the case with Melissa alone, either. At almost all times there were at least six patients for a total of two or three therapists. One morning a woman even brought her labrador into the treatment room and it proceeded to bound around, off-leash, for her entire session. I'm a dog lover as much as the next person, but it's bad enough I have to share precious time with other members of the same species, much less a dog!\n\nUltimately, I received no relief, no specialized attention and no care. I stopped treatment after three visits and would not recommend this clinic. In addition, as Mark said, be sure to read the \""Welcome\"" form - it will inform you what your insurance deductible is and how much has been met. Under my plan, previous chiropractic and physical therapy treatments had not been subject to a deductible, but my benefits had recently changed. I was shocked to get a bill in the mail for $570! That is an outrageous amount to pay for such poor care: patients need to be informed of what mediocre medical treatment will cost them. \n\nI will add that, after expressing my dissatisfaction to the Patient Services manager, she was quick to respond and offer a resolution that I thought was fair. As stated before, the entire staff is courteous and patient, but I would caution that it may be worth your time to seek treatment elsewhere."
0,"I have never in my life been to a hotel that will charge you for every little extra you can imagine.  $15 a day for internet/wi-fi access and $10 a day for access to the gym.  If you are on vacation for 4 days, do the math, it adds up quick.  And you pretty much need wi-fi access because neither me nor my wife could get a cell phone reception in our room even though we had windows facing outside.  Wait a year and pretty soon they will charge you for towels, the pool, and cleaning your room.  Oh, and this was our honeymoon, which the hotel did NOTHING special or comp'd us anything on our special occasion."
0,"I ate there for lunch and when I ordered the burger it came in five minutes.   On the way out saw the cook warming some pre cooked burgers on the grill.  If I wanted a pre cooked burger I could of just gone to McDonalds and it wouldn't have cost me 16 bucks,  I expected better."
1,"Super clean, extremely friendly staff, and amazing food. Had the coconut soup, pad Thai, and panang curry and even my two toddlers were licking their plates! Definitely going to try the lunch buffet sometime and next time will bring some wine along bc it's byob."
1,Been a fan of Fausto's for years now and thanks to Yelp I found out about this location. Was also happy to see one of the hardest workers from Stephanie location working at this one. Great food. Can't go wrong with a bacon breakfast burrito.
0,"I wish I could write a review about how excellent the food was at D'lish but I don't know. The website says they are open Monday through Sunday from 10 - 3; however, when we arrived at 11:10 Sunday, the doors were locked and it was dark inside contrary to the \""Come in.  We're open. \"" sign on the door. The hours on the door were 10:30 - 3. No big deal.....just a half hour difference from the website but if you call the message on the answering machine informs you that they are open Monday through Friday only. What is it? Are they open on weekends or not?  I tried to get the answer by messaging them on the website only to receive an error stating that the message could not go through. I guess they don't want the business with all the inconsistency. What a waste of a Restaurant.com gift certificate!"
1,"Fifth & Wine is a nice wine bar in Old Town. The staff was great, very helpful. In fact, they sat down with us repeatedly throughout our visit to check on us, tell us a little bit about the place and the menu. \n\nThe bruschetta is delicious, inventive and reasonably priced. They only have one Sauvignon Blanc, but the one they have is pretty good. Lots of cozy couch seating in addition to the bar and table set-ups. Great happy hour. Check it."
1,"If your opinion of 'French' is anything but adoration, this place will change your mind.\nThe staff are so friendly and you really can relax and feel like home there. \n\nIf nothing else, come for the divine hocolate tarts! \n\nPS: They do have wifi but no signs up for it ,so just ask!"
0,"This place totally sucks when it comes to customer service.  Went there with a buddy tonight for dinner at 10:25pm...working late.  After we were sat down the server told us that they we're only serving wings and appetizers.  Ok, so we ordered our drinks.  When she brought our drinks she then told us that we can only order fried items and no flat breads.  Mind you, they say they are open until 11pm.  If you don't want to cook after 10pm then close at 10pm.  I was pissed!!!  Went to Native Grill but couldn't order anything from the grill.  Just doesn't make sense.  We just left!!!  I do not recommend this place at all!!!"
1,Really good buffet.  It was very hard for me to control myself and not over-eat.  I failed!  My stomach felt like it was ready to explode.  There was a lot of food that I still wanted to try but I ran out of room in my stomach.
0,"I have to go with the review (Mireille M.) talking about the service.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, the food is EXCELLENT.  And if the chef was cooking at my house, I would give him/her 4 stars.  I also think the atmosphere is cozy and enjoyable.  \n\nBut the path to being a great restaurant (and a great restauranteur) is hiring and training a smart and knowledgeable staff who can talk about the food without reading verbatim from their specials card AND know something (anything?) about the wine list.  They are the point of contact for the dining experience.  Our guy seemed nice but really couldn't answer any questions about the food, the wine, current events, basic math, anything.  \n\nBecause of the price-point relative to the service, I have to say I've experienced MUCH better in Pittsburgh."
1,"Typical old-style casino and hotel. My first impression was good. It's nicely taken care of on the outside with lots of parking. 2nd impression: Really smelly. It wreaks of smoke and just oldness. I hated that, but I'm not a smoker. 3rd impression: great customer service! The employees must be well-taken care of and well-trained. They were smiling, happy and a joy to be around. 4th impression: Room is older, but remodeled. It's comfortable. I had a nice view of the mountains and part of the strip. It wasn't as clean as I like. The granite table top in the room is beautiful but the de sign was so busy it made it difficult to see all of the residue left from prior meals. It was really sticky,  the bathroom door had finger prints all over it, the baseboards of the bed were muddied, and a beer can was forgotten under the armoire. The bathroom was spotless though!! And nicely remodeled with a neutral marble and tile. This is not a classy hotel but it is cheap, close to Chinatown, has a reportedly killer dim sum restaurant and has really great customer service."
0,"Spirit Airlines..... where to begin? \n\nI flew you once back in May and swore to myself that I would never fly with you guys again. Sure, you make it known: \""You get a seat-- That's it. --You hungry? Thirsty? Then you betta pay up mothaf*ka\"" \n\nSo you have this cool little gimmick about how your rates are SOOO low, but you stress the tight seating and additional fees.  \nTight seating? ==Not a problem. \nI'm no princess or 'leg room nazi'.  It's the fact that every time I fly you guys something goes wrong.  First flight I had with you guys, we ended up in Pennsylvania. I was supposed to land in Baltimore.  One of the bathrooms was broken and it ended up being a full plane ride bathroom break for the ONE working bathroom.  Then we landed and I proceeded to baggage claim where I waited for my luggage for nearly an hour.  \n\nThis recent flight, I got slapped with an additional 50 bucks for my bag being too \""heavy\"".  I already paid 40 bucks to check it and even looked for something to indicate that it was going to be a little bit more weight.  I guess theres \""fine print\"" that explains it.  There always is, isn't there? \n\nWell. To conclude this review: Pay the extra 100 or so bucks for an ACTUAL airline because you end up paying what you \""save\"" with Spirit anyways.  \n\nGet yourself some leg room and that bag of complimentary peanuts.  It may not be a meal, but shit, it's better than nothing."
1,"This was, hands down, my favorite meal in my inaugural trip to Las Vegas, even though none of us anticipated the high price tag. I still think about it, a lot. Too much, even, probably.\n\nI didn't realize that they closed at 10:00 that night and, when we walked in at 9:30, we were welcomed graciously and seated/attended to promptly. Service throughout continued to be excellent, even after we found out that they were closing in just a few minutes.\n\nI was in the mood for scallops, but after the waiter's incredibly convincing description of the shellfish platter, we opted for that as an appetizer, as well.  It was amazing... and this is coming from someone formerly (and still a little bit) afraid of removing the exoskeleton of crustaceans. He gave us an extra oyster shooter, too, since there were three of us and the platter was only designed for two. The bottle of red wine he suggested (I don't remember what it was, I was too enraptured with the seafood platter) went perfectly with the meal, too. I still ordered the scallops and, while I remember them being tasty (and they left out the bacon in the polenta on my plate), that seafood platter won the meal for me.\n\nAnd for my trip to Vegas."
1,I read about their Operation Santa Claus holiday charity campaign via friends on Yelp (thanks Jolly!) and called in to make a donation to help those in need.  I am always impressed when a media outlet gives up their airtime to support a local charity....kudos to the team @ ABC 15 for putting together this event!
0,"Horrible food, horrible service. Can't believe this place is still in business! With all of the amazing sushi places in town, why would anyone come here more than once? Do yourself a favor and drive five more minutes to Ohjah on Decatur. Don't waste your money."
1,Super good! I haven't had anything bad yet. Both the red and green sauce are great. Good seafood options too.
0,"Brand new, but lacking luster.  \n\nThe descriptions on the menu belie the actual appetizers and entrees.  This \""gastropub\"" was suggested to me for happy hour by a colleague.  At first appearances the menu suggests interesting twists on standard pub fair, but don't be fooled.  I ordered the \""dewedged\"" salad that claims pancetta as an ingredient.  What actually appeared on my plate was cold chewy bacon bits.  The consensus at the table was that the food fell far short of what was touted by the waitress as being made predominantly in-house.\n\nThere's a caveat to the $2 can Tuesday happy hour: It only applies to beers $4.50 and under.  Sadly, the beer selection is limited generally.  The beer selection priced at $4.50 and under forces you to choose from run-of-the-mill beers like Red Stripe, Blue Moon, and Yuengling.\n\nI had a better experience at Industry Public House in Lawrenceville."
0,"Restaurant is beautifully decorated and has great potential.  However, the food needs work.  The hummus was some of the worst I've had...very bland and pasty.  The falafel sandwich was ok, but also lacking in flavor.  The chicken shawarma was drenched in nutmeg, making it the only flavor that you could taste.  The eggplant appetizer was the only bright point in the meal.  Although heavily drenched in oil, the flavor was good.  The service was good and pleasant.  I was so hoping for a delicious middle eastern restaurant close to home.  The search continues..."
0,"Big hype about Hakkasan! On the guestlist and in 'girls only' line on a Saturday nignt for 3 (!!!!) hours to finally get in... Club is mediocer, nothing special, not worth the wait or the hype... Ok ok Calvin Harris made up for it a bit, still would not recommend it."
1,"I would love to give a 5 star rating except my mashed potatoes and vegetables come to the table cold. I haven't said anything and even though they are cold they are still good.\n\nService:\nThe staff is friendly and they are great about waiting on you. They are very helpful when your wanting to know what the specials are, which changes on a daily basis.\n\nThe Food:\nFor me I love a down right good home made chicken fried steak dinner. I'm one of those good ol texas boys that loves to eat meat and potatoes. The potatoes are really good and seem to be real potatoes. If they are fake, then they have fooled me. The brown gravy I usually ask for on the side is really good. You can also get a homemade biscuit and that by itself is a meal of it's on. You can tell its homemade. The best part of all is the chicken fried steak. You can look at it and tell the batter is from scratch and nice and crunchy and very flavorful when it goes down the tube. If your looking for a really great chicken fried steak dinner thats homemade with all the fixins......this is the place to go to. Got room for desert? You are crazy if you do. Be prepared for an all time mini pie maybe a 10 incher or less. Either way it's big and they have plenty of different homemade pies to chose from, just ask the waitress. I ordered the Banana Cream, let's just say it was bananas.....no way could I eat it all. \n\nNeedless to say I brought mom here before and I'll continue to go here."
0,"I don't know what it is about this place, but they are slooooooooow. The food is adequate (please don't lecture me about fast food, why are you even reading this review?), but sitting at the drive-in will shorten your life. Or maybe just feel like it. \n\nI prefer some of their stuff to McDonald's (yes, I'm very discerning) but just cannot abide the wait."
1,"The first impression of this place is that it is in the middle of nowhere. It is also really small inside. \nStaff immediately greets you and explains the menu. They're all very friendly and helpful. \nI had their new veggie burger. Black bean, rice, chipotle burger with coleslaw and avocado. It was quite delicious. I hate coleslaw, but this was very edible. Quite delicious. I had it paired with truffle fries, they were pretty good as well. \nMy friend had a slaw chee salad with seared ahi. It was very tasty. We both agreed we could eat that every week for the rest of the foreseeable future. \nI can see us going back here really soon. Everything was delicious, even their water which had oranges, strawberries and such in it. \nI hate how small this place is though. We were there for lunch and many people were leaving or taking food to go since there was nowhere to sit. I wouldn't want to take food to go from here. It is nowhere near home, nor anywhere else you can go sit and eat. All around this place is very good. Just be wary of going in at typical lunch times. It cleared out a bit by 3pm. Around 1:30 though there was nowhere to sit. \nI can't wait to go back and try some different things. I dot eat meat, so there isn't a vast amount of things I can eat, but there is a few good choices."
0,"Meh. I don't know. This was good. Just good. \n\nMy fiance enjoyed this more than I did. The food was a 3 for me, the service? 1 or 2, probably a 1. I think we were there 2 hours to get a beer each and a burger. \n\nThey had a burger with brie and a lamb burger. I order anything with brie, and my other half orders anything with lamb. So, that was good. And the food wasn't bad I just can't get over the terrible service."
0,***As an update the Manager has contacted me and apologized for not following through on the night of the incident it sounds as if there was a little miscommunication with some of the staff. He has offered to take care of us if we come back. We will be going back to see if they make things right.***
0,"Gosh I hate to be the one to do this but, this was not even near 5 star caliber to me (especially comparing to other caf\u00e9s in the area like Lux).\n\nI had some errands to run in Cen Pho and I really didn't want to totally derail my diet for lunch. So I did a yelp search for salads and this popped up. Imagine my delight to find all raving reviews! I headed over immediately.\n\nI love the atmosphere. It's really cute and cozy, but a little industrial too with the concrete floors and counters. Love, love the teal chairs, white brick walls and fresh flowers.\n\nAnyway, the service, while nice, was pretty aloof. And it wasn't busy so I don't know what the deal was. Perhaps they were busy making call in lunch orders that I was ignored?\n\nI got a small spinach salad. For $4 I felt the portion was fair. However, my salad was supposed to come with Pomagranate and it didn't have it on there. I initially wanted to try the soup but they had run out (by noon?).\n\nI got a Belgian waffle for my son. My salad came out (which took awhile), I finished it and we were still waiting on the waffle. I was trying to catch the eye of one of the employees because my son was really hungry, and he's 4 so he was about to go postal.\n\nFinally a young girl asked of there was anything else, and I reminded her of the waffle and cookie we ordered. Her response was oh sorry that wasn't on the ticket (she was being polite not snarky - never know how that might come across in a review). But she was the one who took my order so I was confused as to how those items were left off the ticket.\n\nAnyway, the waffle and cookie finally came out. They were really good. In fact, the food is really good and fresh. No doubt about that.\n\nBut my overall experience was just weird. In fact on the way out, a gentleman asked how was everything and I was like ok, food was good but it took a long time and the Pomagranate was left off my salad. His response, were there pomagranates supposed to be on your salad? I was like yeah all the ingredients of the salad are right here on the menu. He just shrugged his shoulders and said yeah it happens sometimes. He wasn't rude, but dismissive. Didn't apologize or anything.\n\nAs I walked out, one of the ladies was rolling out dough to make cinnamon rolls. They are probably delicious. \n\nThey seem like super nice people who serve good food. But they could use improvement on the customer service and efficiency."
0,"Horrible, horrible, horrible. I calked to get an appointment. Explained I didn't want a full groom as my dog is 15+ years old and can't tolerate standing that long and gets stressed, but still want her coat shaved for comfort. So I bring her in and wait for her - none of the three hour appt. stuff. Get there and they tell me come back in two hours to get her, I explain that's not what I scheduled for, dog too old, just want shaved, they look for the girl who took the appt and she stood there and to my face I never said it was a \""straight through\"". I said I told you the dog was too obs, just wanted groomed, couldn't tolerate a long appointment and she says you didn't say straight through, very argumentative. The groomer says she will do it, will have to call other client to say it will be longer, guilt factor towards me.\nThen I hear someone in the back scolding a dog saying stop it over and over in a mean voice so now I definitely wasn't leaving.\nThey bring my dog out 35 minutes later looking a mess, saying can you pet her, she's getting too stressed, I said, it's fine we just want to go. My dog is patchy, horrible but I just wanted her out if their hands.\nPlace stinks like cheap pine sol, staff seem to not be too customer focused.\nThen they ask four different people what they should charge since she didn't get a bath, blow, brush, just a straight shave. No one knows so they charge me full price $65. I said \""do you really think that's a fair price? And the cashier says the groomers are contractors so they can charge whatever they want.\nWill never go back and will tell everyone I know to stay away! They are ridiculous and I expect them to be closed in 6 months."
0,Abuelo's is OK. There is nothing fantastic about it. I ordered the Juarez. I asked that the cheese enchilada be beef instead. I was told it would be no problem. That did not happen. It came out cheese. I sat at the bar.  The bartender was nice. Run of the mill service. If you come here just know you're walking into a run of the mill Mexican restaurant.
0,"I'll keep this short... I'm from Seattle, I have high expectations when it comes to any Asian food. \n\nMu shu is my favorite thing in the world, don't crush my mu shu dreams by saying it will come with pancake when you give flour tortillas. PANCAKE IS NOT FLOUR TORTILLA! ...sigh. \n\nSecond, if you do Happy Family please don't include fake crab/krab. The flavor of that is too overpowering to be part of a Happy Family. Boo for ruining happy family, iron chef. \n\nIf I had NO other dinner option I might order from here again, but the high reviews are deceiving...or I'm just used to a higher caliber of food I guess."
1,"If you are looking for a little bit 'nicer' place for great pizza, this is your spot.  Be prepared to pay for it though.\n\nWhile I would still tip my hat to full on flavor and freshness for the value to places like Mellow Mushroom, this is a great break from the norm for a bit nicer meal with your special someone.  We had the San Daniele Prosciutto app ($15) (burrata cheese, arugula, basil, aged balsamic (this one also had some fresh cantelope)) and it was fantastic!  We also ordered the Isole e Olena Sangiovese ($55) which was definitely overpriced for the taste.  I would recommend the Ciacci Sangiovese which is almost half the price and has better flavor.  \n\nThe pizza was full of flavor and was thinner than I had expected.  It held together nicely and they were generous with the toppings.  We shared the Roasted Wild Mushroom which has spinach, robiola cheese, mozz and truffle oil.  It was delicious but I would recommend 2 pizzas if you are hungry.  They are full portion for 1 or you can share as we did, if you are having apps and dessert.\n\nMy bride ordered the Chocolate Cake and coffee with Baileys and I ordered the Fresh Berry Cobbler.  This course was a waste and I would recommend sticking to apps and pizza and maybe walking down to Dean & Deluca for a good dessert.  I think the desserts+coffees with one shot of Baileys was around $30.  The total bill was $121 + tip.  I would be choosier with the order next time because while it was fantastic, you could still have a great meal and dodge some of the expense.  For that amount of money, there are nicer meals you could enjoy in Charlotte.  We will return though because if the other pizzas are as good as that one, it's worth trying it and being smarter with the bill."
1,"Atmospherorific. That is a new word I want spread around for LGO because it entails all I want out of a restaurant. Of course good food, jeez, let me get to that, but as far as elemental funtastic vibes are concerned, this place hits the mark on many points.\n     Ok, so the food. Yum. I really like the Daybreaker that is an egg white omelet with turkey and their own tomato avocado salsa but the other day I ventured into \""normalcy\"" and just had 2 eggs cooked \""my way\"" and bacon which maybe I stand alone on this, but love it crispy and it was perfect.\nYou can also get a bottle of wine and they'll open it for you, but overall, the place is kind of self serve which is fine because I can serve myself. Get your own napkins, water, coffee fixings, etc. Think I can handle that for a change.\n     LGO is the ideal complement to the next door Postino, especially if you're out for the day. LGO grocery for breakie/brunch then off to Postino for some $5 wines daydrinking extravaganza...they're like the Bert and Ernie of Campbell & 40th street. Or maybe a better reference would be Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel seeing the one is better during the day and one is better during the night. \n     Ah, references shmereferences. LGO kicks ass :)"
0,"Sub Par at best, Carne Asada plate two bland pieces of steak, tough and you have to chop it up yourself, the rice is bleh. I live down the street and I thought I would give this place a second chance due to construction on McDowell Rd, I'll continue going to LosBetos from now on. Even the photos on their drive thru menu look bland."
0,"Buffet? Well just because I live in Las Vegas doesn't mean I like to gamble with my food! We went to the Rampart Buffet around 11AM. It was about $16 each to enter and I was wildly disappointed with the food. The shrimp laid out next to the sandwich  mayonnaise totally grossed me out, the ham at the breakfast bar was brown, english muffin ...well I don't know how old it was but my fiance's butter knife wouldn't cut thru it. \n\nI played it safe and had a salad ( tasty! ) and some strawberries. \n\nI wish I could have done a walk thru before I paid to eat there. Barf."

0,"Horrrrrribbble experience here!! Not a place to come to for dancing or drinking. This \""club\"" as the guys handing out flyers called it is a complete  RIP and they say whatever they have to to get you in the door. We got these bracelets while walking to the mirage that was supposed to give us 1/2 off admission. Hubby still had to pay $20 and I  had to pay $10 to get in. Ladies get free drinks before midnight and after 2pm. We got in around 11:45 pm.  I spent about 20min. hanging over the bar trying to get the bartender's attn. There were girls next to me who waited longer and were pissed because the bartenders ignored them so they wouldn't have to givethem free drinks. i ordered 2 amaretto sours and it came out to $24! And they wouldn't take the 2 for 1 coupon that these tards handed to us on the strip. Music sucked a$$. DJ was white and only played black \""lean wit it\"" type of music.  I had already dropped $50 so i wanted to atleast try and enjoy myself. Didn't happen. We sat down in the lounge area to rest my feet and wait for a decent song to groove to. A waitress came up to us and told us we would have to spend $250 and buy a bottle if we wanted to sit!!! I can't believe that there were some people there who acutally spent that much and more just to sit and look cool. This place is whack, small, expensive, and deceiving. DO NOT GO HERE, wait the 2 hours in line to get into the Jet."
0,The pizza is like a better little Caesars. Nothing special. I just went here because Mama Mia's was closed due to plumbing issues.
0,"Horrible and Worst service I've ever had! It's too slow in spite of not busy at all around 2:30PM.We just got drinks and Olive oil&black pepper, that's all.And I don't know why though without bread. Our waiter who is bartender didn't care at all so we did wait to order for 10min. It's waist of time totally.So we left there, just leave $10 on the table. What a lucky bartender!! Anyway I would never back this restaurant."
0,Warning. This is a franchise selling only 1/4 pound skinless dogs for 8 bucks each. No original skinless dogs sold. It is a nice food court but the dog tasted like something you buy at the airport except at higher prices. Bun was as stale as last years matzah.
1,"I recently had my hair done by Suzanne, and I couldn't be happier!! Most of my family and I have been going to her for 10+ years. She always does an amazing job for both men and women. I got my hair dyed this time. I sent her a picture of what I wanted ahead of time, and she went out her way to track down the perfect colors for the job. She really cares about her work and making sure it is perfect. Again, I couldn't be happier about my hair. So glad she's at a salon right around the corner from my house!"
0,"Something has got to be done about the abominable service at The Bread Company.. It's such a shame because their food is not bad, but the service is so badly below standard, I decided I am simply never coming back here.\n\nThere is one particular worker with tattoos on his arm who is very insolent towards customers, raising his voice at them for asking questions.\n\nFor months, I've ordered a grilled sandwich to pick up for lunch time, and the result is totally random. If the owner (tall bald guy) is there when you call, chances are you'll get a good sandwich with the potatoes and salad on the side, but if he's not there, watch out: there's no telling what you'll get. Sometimes they include potatoes and salad with the sandwich, sometimes they don't. Sometimes they slice the sandwich, sometimes they don't. Sometimes the sandwich is available since the grill is on, and other times it's not even available since they turn off the grill in the middle of the day to save money randomly.\n\n\nToday for example, I went to pick up my grilled sandwich to-go, and was surprised to see that on this occasion there were no potatoes and salad included, even though two weeks ago I ordered around the same time and they were included. So I asked the short-haired lady in front of me behind the register, \""are there potatoes and salad?\"" (pointing at the sandwich) and she stared directly at my eyes without answering! So I repeated the question and she stood there completely quiet, staring at me without answering, when the tattooed arm punk butted in our conversation, cocked his head at me and yelled, \""didn't we go over this already?!\"" \n\nDon't bother coming here. Unless the owner fires some of the incompetent and insolent flunkies buzzing behind the counter soon, this place needs to go out of business ASAP."
1,"My friends and I kept calling this the 'Chilis of Montreal\"". Everywhere we turned, we found one of these places. We visited this locale twice since it was in walking distance of our hotel. \n\nFirst things first, the beer here...delicious. They brew it themselves and have a couple of flavors to choose from. Both times, I went with the Blanche, which has a hint of fruit in it and it was delicious. For the better bang for your buck, get the liter. It's massive and quite heavy, but worth it for less than $10! \n\nWe also had various plates here for lunch one day. We tried their burgers, flat pizza, poutine and pasta. Everyone seemed quite satisfied and to top it off, we had great service when we were there both times."
0,"This place is just \""ok\"" Yes, the punch card makes it pretty cheap. But, now I am regretting buying it. My son just doesn't play as long here as the other indoor places. I think because there is no \""toys\"" besides stuff to climb on.\n\n My biggest fault with this place is VIDEO GAMES. Why are they in a kids play place? The idea is to get the kids out of the house and active. My 2 yr old wants to just play games. I can stay at home and do that.\n\nMy advice,....get rid of the video games and put in some imaginative toys like maybe a play kitchen, doll house, tool bench, puzzles/book center etc.....\n\nAlso, all the snacks are JUNK except for maybe goldfish. But, the Plus is you can bring your own."
0,"Not too sure how to think about this place yet. But i'll tell you about the 3 things I got.\n\nCabeza Taco - AMAZING. rich, smooth, and with the cut of the salsa from the salsa bar, really how you want one of these bad boys to taste!\n\nChorizo Taco - sorta dry, which despite how rich i'm sure the meat was is a bit shocking.\n\nAl Pastor Torta - really quite terrible. The whole thing was dry and the pastor was bland. There wasn't any mayo or cheese in there to moisten it up and as a restaurant, that based on it's various graphics bills itself as a pastor joint you'd think they'd be able to do better.\n\nI guess maybe the should advertise with pictures of cabeza? probably not because cabeza looks sorta gnarly but lawwwd its' good"
0,"I was not impressed. Music is way too loud. The food is OK but nothing to brag about. With so many great restaurants to choose from, i would not go back or recommend STK.\n\nWe started with the tuna tartare which was average at best. At 19 bucks that tuna should have rocked as loud as the music they are play. I had the sirloin steak which was tough and fatty. Sounds like a girl i dated in high school. Ughhhh\nThe side dish was the Mac n Cheese which was good. I will say the service was very good. No complaints there. \n\nSo if you don't mind average food with LOUD music then STK is for you."
1,"My niece requested Chompie's while in town visiting from the east coast. It is a safe selection since there is something for everyone. Unless you hate food, there is bound to be something you like.  Except if you are my grandma, who was not pleased that the tongue listed on the menu was not available. \n\nBut, really, out of all the burgers, omelets, smoked fish, salads and schnitzel on the menu, why would one want to order tongue in the first place? Just get pastrami!\n\nShe did order wine to drown her sorrow, which arrived in an impressively large and  filled to the rim wine glass. It was perhaps the largest serving of wine I have seen at a restaurant.  In my opinion, this totally outweighs the lack of beef tongue.  My impossible-to-please grandmother may disagree, but luckily she cannot remember how to operate the web browser on her computer to write Yelp reviews.\n\nWe usually go to the Tempe location but I was just as pleased with the Chandler location. Perhaps more pleased for the following two reasons:\n1) In addition to the complimentary pickles, there was also complimentary bread. This may not be specific to location, it could just be a new implementation. Regardless, I like bread.  \n2) In addition to the normal sampling of crumb cake at the bakery counter, there was also sampling of cookies.  FULL-SIZED COOKIES.  Nothing starts a meal better than a chocolate dipped, sprinkled covered, buttery cookie. Well played, Chompies, well played.\n\nAs always, they had a display case full of temptations: 7 layers of chocolate cake, cupcakes doubled in height by frosting, and cookies the size of Frisbees.\n\nAnd, as if their menu was not big enough, they had added quite a few new options, such as a kale salad and flat-bread pizzas.  Everything was very tasty and as usual, my brother made it a personal challenge to eat as much food as possible (he managed 4 sliders and a plateful of onion rings). It was fascinating and horrified my grandmother, who just couldn't bring herself to look away."
0,Everyone looks for that little hole in the wall that turns out to be a gem in the rough.  This isn't it.  it's closer to rough than gem.  Food is iffy at best.  Service is borderline.  They have good hours and the chips are relatively fresh so all is not a loss.

0,"The Orleans Showroom is a nice venue where nearly every seat is a good one.  The sound is great and the stage is pretty huge.  I have seen a dozen shows there and staff for the most part are helpful.\n\nMost recent experience is folks coming from the back- the cheap seats and block views from the higher paying seats.  Please don't sell $113 seats and let the folks from the $30 block the view. I get it- people like to get up and dance- a good song comes on and people get excited but Ushers please do your job.\n\nI asked the usher to ask people to go back to their seats because they were blocking the view.  The Usher said \""It sucks doesn't it?\""  Yes, sir, it sucks when you don't do your job.\n\nNormally a nice venue but Management- please manage."
0,"Great atmosphere, food is not good. Salsa tasted like a metal can. Taco meat was awful. Guac was just ok, queso was ok but a little lumpy..this was my second visit and will be my last and it is a shame because I love sitting up on the roof:( they need an overhaul on their recipes.. Worst Mexican food I have ever had and Mexican is my favorite"
1,"Me and my husband decided to try this New Mexican Restaurant (despite already having a \""usual\"" Mexican place we frequent). We showed up 10 minutes before they closed and honestly expected a little rushing on their part perhaps a little attitude .... I know how it is when customers come in minutes before closing when you're expecting to start clean up and get out of there. However, we were treated very patiently and kindly by the hostess, waiter and busier. We were really hungry and they brought out chips, salsa, retried beans, and grilled onions and peppers! It was great. I was even more pleased to see that they had a section on the menu for vegetarians!! I was thrilled! We got our food rather fast, it looked great and tasted great. Serving size was perfect and we were able to take home leftovers. Bathrooms were clean, restaurant had an overall pleasing atmosphere. Hubby and I decided to make this our new home Mexican restaurant!"
0,"We spent the day walking around Outremont. We had planned to stop for a coffee and croissant just because of great reviews. Due to time of day we ended up having lunch instead. Very disappointing.\n\nWe had a small table on the terrace. The tables are so close together we literally could not even into our seats. Please note we are not giants. Once in we could not move. Really I think they could get rid of a couple tables to at least allow customers to move.\n\nMy wife order a salad. That was fine but nothing special. I ordered a sandwich which was supposed to have grilled chicken, tomato, goat cheese, avocado and pesto. Sounded great. I had it on a baguette. It was a small warm sandwich with a little salad on the side. The sandwich was terrible. It had hardly anything in it and what was there was almost indistinguishable. Where the cheese and avocado were I have no idea. There was a little bit of chicken present. \n\nOk so there was not a lot of stuff. What matters is how it tastes. Well it did not taste good at all. It seem like all pesto goop. Soon after it was served the bread had become saturated in the green goop. It was really unpleasant. I should have sent it back.\n\nThe waitress ask me at end of meal if I enjoyed everything. I explained to her how I felt about the sandwich. She said she was sorry to hear that. But did nothing to remedy the situation or to compensate. \n\nWe were planning of having coffee and dessert but our golden rule is when things go bad in a restaurant we cut our loses and stop ordering anymore food.\n\n$35.00 for a salad and a sandwich. If you love it that is fine but when you do not enjoy it, it is a lot to pay. There may be other things on menu that are great but after my experience today we will not be back."

1,"For such a generic sounding name one might thing this is your average corner store but one couldn't be more wrong. \nMy first exposure to this chain was in Hawaii and it surprised me there and when I saw two branches one the strip (the other one is in the fashion mall which is an older one). This is a new one as I hadn't seen it before. I was happy that I would be OK for last minute stuff like water, snacks etc.\nThe prices for drinks in Las Vegas keeps going up so some times one needs to enjoy stuff in the hotel.\nThey have actually a very good selection of Beers and liquors. \nI was on the mood for some beer and was pleasantly surprised to find Delirium Tremens and Nocturnum being carried by them\nThe prices are tiny bit higher than liquor mart or super store but heck we are on the Las Vegas strip here. I picked up my a bottle each for the Deliriums and some water and snacks and I was in business.\nA great place to get last minute items."

0,"Gecko was recommended by our Lexus dealership.  They arrived at our home on Saturday, two unfriendly boys in an unmarked truck.  They opened their doors with music blaring while they installed in our quiet neighborhood at 9am Saturday, very unprofessional.  After they left, a sensor on our windshield fell off near the mirror.  They had put it up with cheap white two-sided tape, a small strip with gaps on both sides.  They also did not scrape off the old glue so it was very uneven.  I called but had to wait and have them return at my business on Monday.  It was the same two boys and they used the same white cheap tape, one small strip with gaps showing on both sides...it fell down again in a couple of hours.  The same unfriendliness was exhibited by both boys.  I called again, they said they did not install sensors on windshields normally so they would have to order the proper black tape from the internet and would call in 4-5 days.  On Thursday I called them.  The tape was in so they would have the boys out to our business Friday.  The same two unfriendly boys, the same cheap white tape in hand so I  told them not again.  I called and the lady told me the boys were supposed to have picked up the proper tape before coming to my location.  I called to complain to Safellite Glass, they were paying the bill to Gecko. However, I was  meeting resistance and cover up from Gecko to Safellite.  Geckos position to Safellite was that our sensor was after market and not normally covered.  This was not true, this sensor came from the dealer new.  In any case, if you have an after market sensor, you must be out of luck with Gecko. I finally returned to the dealer who had to mount the sensor after 1 week and multiple calls and having to deal with these two unprofessional boys.  The dealer told me Steve was out all week or this would not have happened.  I can only tell you that there are a lot of glass companies in Phoenix and I would not use Gecko again, especially these two rude and unprofessional boys that were sent out each trip."
0,Worst urgent care I have ever visited.  Doctor didn't even touch me when I went in for severe back pain.  Just prescribed me pain pills even after telling her my history of spinal surgery.  And she told me to do stretches.  \n\nThen they took my credit card and gave me someone else's receipt!  Then I get a bill in the mail for $50.  I pay it through my bill pay and I get an email from them saying they charged my credit card $50.  I wrote back twice trying to get a refund for one of the extra $50 charged.  No response.  Called them and the chick on the phone says I need a check number.  I explained I paid it through bill pay so there is no check number.  She had no record of me paying twice.  How convenient!  Then I ask for a supervisor and of course he was unavailable.  He was supposed to call me but never did.  So I disputed the charge through my bank and at least I get one of my $50 back.  \n\nI do NOT recommend ever visiting this establishment.  There are plenty other urgent care facilities.  Save the aggravation and steer clear of this place.

I called and spoke to a manager, and was told it would be looked into. The extra 35 dollars was refunded several days later, but I never received a call back, or any apology of any sort. \nThat is extremely shady- and stealing! To not even get at least an apology is poor business practice."
0,"Horrible!  We waited for over an hour for 3 gluten free fried rice dishes and one other dish.  Finally had to ask to see the manager.  He was stunned we were waiting. Many, many other tables had come and gone.  Our waitress never once came to our table to talk about the wait.  The manager then claimed it was because we had gluten free.  We eat at PF Changs often. This was not a gluten free - takes an hour issue.  It was a bad waitress and cook staff issue!  Will not go back to this location ever!"

0,"The selection of spirits was not inspired. I was intrigued by the idea that I could sample some craft beer and get a growler, especially since it was 107\u00b0.  This turned out not to work so good.  The proprietor asked if I was looking for something, and I said no, I was browsing.  Which I did.  Since I didn't see anything else interesting, I went over and read all the info on the beers on tap.  Then I read them again.  Since the guy was sitting and laughing with a couple ten feet from me, I figured he'd ask if I wanted something.  Nope.  Guess they sell enough $35 growlers that they don't have to worry about selling another one to an out-of-towner.  Maybe the store is kind of a hobby operation, though it seems like an expensive one.\n\nI should have just butted in to his conversation, but I was feeling kind of Midwestern.  I noticed the other day that Total Wines has growlers too, but they have people that ask what you want, and they have quarts as well as half gallons, which is more attractive in some cases.  I'd have given these guys three stars on their selection and they could've earned another on the service.  Instead, they lost one."
1,"The food is crap.  I'm not trying to be mean, but it really is horrible.  I'd rather eat one of those Tornado things from Circle K for dinner.  Also, I don't appreciate the waitress telling me everything is great when everything is absolutely not great.  What kind of disgusting excuse for food must she live off of if the nachos get her stamp of approval?  They were probably the worst nachos I've ever had.  Taco Bell's nachos are like manna from heaven compared to the sad mess Barney's serves.  She should have just been honest and told me to order fries a la carte, because that was the only thing my friend and I enjoyed.\n\nWe ended up just going back to her place and lying on the floor for a while because our stomachs were so upset. \n\nOnly drink at Barney's.  If you eat, stick to fries.  The pizza is a safe bet too.  Whatever you do, don't order the nachos, onion rings, or the grilled chicken wrap.  Hell, just go on Thursday and drink until it all tastes good.  Problem solved.\n\nObviously, Thursday night gets to keep the four star rating.  I can't help it.  I will never get too old for Barney's Thursday nights.  Well, I probably will eventually, but not today.  Not today."

1,"This place is a home run every time!\n\nAlways a nice spot for a date or intimate dinner with close friends and family, Tutti Santi is our go-to for authentic Italian.  The service is top notch.   \n\nTheir gnocchi is, in my opinion, the best in the Valley.  Try it with their pink sauce (you need to request this as the menu lists a cream sauce with a splash of marinara).  \n\nMy husband loves the Ravioli alla Nina.  It's so good. Sometimes ravioli dishes are so darn heavy, but not here!  Nina's sauces \nachieve the fine balance of lightness and flavor and this dish is a prime example.\n\nFinally, try the tiramisu.  Light, fluffy and packed with flavor, this dessert is a great way to end a wonderful meal."
1,"Giant burritos,  Uncomfortable chairs, limited hot sauce selection and  growing prices.\n\nThis review shouldn't be useful to most as if you have had chipotle one place you have had it everywhere. This is the latest location in down town phoenix, it is a popular lunch spot and not a bad option when you need a quick bite.\n\nTheir guise of healthy is tempted by the realty that a burrito can quickly soar past 1000 calories. It is nice that they have added brown rice as a option at no added cost.\n\nI had the vegetarian fajita burrito 6.85 Brown rice, fajita veggies, black beans (the pinto are not veg) salsa cheese and don't forget the included guacamole at no extra charge.\n\nHere is a great tip, before opening your burrito, give it a massage, mix up the inside so you don't end up with a bite of pure guacamole or rice.  \n\nFir seats you get to choose from small hard wood seats with a back or small padded backless fixed bar stools, both say eat and leave ASAP. \n\nOver all its something to eat that is not bad or to pricey and the location and addition of brown rice makes it a 4 star from what would be a 3 star chain."
1,"First, let me say that I'm not one to eat at a buffet, sorely because i lose my appetite when I see piles of foods on trays lined up from one end of the wall to another.\n\nI was forced (yes, forced!) to go here with my family - party of 8 with two toddlers. Usually, for big parties wiith messy toddlers, the host would normally sit you in the corner away from other gobbling patrons, but not our case. we were just a few feet away from the food, yet not too close from foot traffic.\n(that's 1 star)\n\nThe buffet, being in the Orleans casino, serves southren food (among other \""international theme\"") - from crawfish to hush puppies. They also have cooked and raw oysters. Not bad for a $20. The only drawback is the desert section - they dont have much to offer tehre. But then again, I get stuffed easily and usually dont have much room for sweet shutffs.\n(that's 2 stars)\n\nThis is no Rio buffet, so there's really not much waiting. However, being that it was graduation week, there were a lot of locals with their graduating kids (still on their cap n gown). Stilll, we only waited for about 8 minutes.\n(that's 1 star)\n\nI got a bad impression of our server at first because instead of neatly placing our silverwares on the table, she would just toss it from the other end of the table, so I had to catch my fork as bouncess across the table. \n(that's -1 star)"
0,"I've been here a bunch and I want to continue supporting this place, I really do. But they make it nearly impossible. The kitchen staff works hard and the food is OK.

Their pasta dishes are wonderful, and come to think of it, just the smell of the place is a pleasant trip to Italy. Salads can be sparse (I like a salad with lots and lots of veggies and no iceberg lettuce, thank-you...), but everything else is great. \n\nPrices are reasonable. Waiters are family folks. I can't recall being in there when Mom and Pop Basso weren't there. They're very warm and cordial, and will make sure you don't go hungry."
0,"Got the Mango smoothie w/ pearls. For some reason, it wasn't that flavorful. I don't just mean it wasn't sweet enough (it wasn't). I mean it was hard to tell that it was mango in there. Also, I found mango fibers, which does tell me that they seem to use real mango, but the texture does detract from the experience of a smoothie. It's like finding a hair, you know? Finally, the pearls weren't at all \""warm\"" and \""chewy\"" as some wise Yelper named Chris V. wrote in his review of the original location. I'd definitely go there instead if you don't live right next door to this one, or maybe even if you do live close by."
1,"Like Chris and Jason mentioned before me, this place is a great and affordable way to get you and your 20+ friends, girlfriends, boyfriends, lovers, buck fuddies, etc a place to sleep and recharge in Vegas. Relatively walking distance from the strip and even a cab ride wouldn't be too pricey on those nights/days of immobile intoxication.\n\nThis place is also great for last minute bookings on not so busy nights. A group of us were able to get a room for $30... booked the day of. Awesome sauce!"
1,"Dined here twice during my stay at the Biltmore - dinner and breakfast. Both were delicious. \n\nDinner\nThey serve complimentary bread with dinner. Its an Italian style white bread with garlic in it, served with honey pecan goat cheese spread. Both are delicious on the their own but imo, sweet goat cheese doesn't really go with garlic bread. \n\nI ordered the Cesar salad with salmon (Not listed on the menu, they charge you $10 for the salmon which I thought was a bargain). The salmon was pan seared and cooked beautifully. They have a garlic-Cesar dressing and it is out of this world! My only  critiques are that the croutons are a little underwhelming. I'm not sure if they make them in house, but they seemed boxed. Also, there was too much cheese in the salad. \n\nBreakfast\nI order the ricotta flap jacks. They are served with (a huge scoop) of vanilla bean butter, blueberry compote and maple syrup. Very good! The flap jacks are light and fluffy and a nice change from regular old pancakes. They also happily swapped out the compote for fresh berries upon request. \n\nI tried some of their regular pancakes and these were really good too - a huge portion too. \n\nIf you order coffee, they'll leave a huge pot at the table. \n\nI'm a little cautious of resort restaurants-sometimes they're overpriced and don't deliver but this place is awesome! The food is good and the menu is diverse. The prices are reasonable.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place."
1,Why oh why don't they have a Cracker Barrel in Califonia??!!  My friends and I were in the Phoenix area this weekend and this was first on our list to eat!  We were excited to eat our breakfast here!  We also love browsing through the country store and sitting outside in the rocking chairs.  I hope one day this chain will expand to the Pacific Coast.
1,"First off, try the kimchi!\n\nI'd give Hodori five stars, because the food is really great. What ruined it for me was the service. The server, whose name escapes me, was very short with us; maybe it was an off day, but I don't know if that's really a valid reason. We're not a very demanding party of two, so we were a bit thrown off.\n\nDespite that minor setback, the bbq chicken and bbq ribs were take-home-for-leftovers worthy. Which is good, because you definitely pay for your portion. Go during lunch, which I believe ends at 3. Half-price meals, which still totals about $12 a person!"
0,"I'm not digging it. Yes, the atmosphere might be fun, but the cupcakes weren't to my expectations. Dry \""cake\"", generic/ processed frosting, and overall not a super good experience."
1,"Had a friend recommend this restaurant when she found out I'd been eating vegetarian lately. Am I ever glad she did! The food was cheap, absolutely delicious and completely veggie. It's a cafeteria-style serving situation, and there were lots of seats, mostly full.\n\nThe spanakopita was great, the cannelloni was also very good and they have ginger beer. The second night I went in, there was a live band playing enjoyable music at a good volume.\n\nI really can't recommend this place highly enough!"
0,"This will NEVER be a shopping destination, for me !\nUnless I need to visit THE APPLE STORE, I'm staying away.\n\nFor the most part, the center is a collection of OVER PRICED restaurants and clubs.\nIf YOU need your ego (or other parts) stroked, by barely 21 year old female WANNA-BEE'S .... Take a VIAGRA and your wallet, with you.\n\nThe parking availability is terrible.\nPlus the Valet reserved zones, have made it shopper unfriendly."
0,Terrible service.  Dry wings. Sent them back no silverware.  We were only table.  Pizza bland and undercooked.   Great TVs and the beer is cold but beer order was mixed up twice

I don't usually write comments, but I really hope this place could have more customers and last a long time in Las Vegas!"
0,"The architecture may be nice, have elevator music and all the fancy schmancy stuff but the customer service sucks and swallows. The employees are rude, they ignore the customers or simply turn around without answering a simple question. I was there yesterday and it was impossible to find someone to help me find a book I needed even the computer said there were two copies left.\n\nThanks God for Amazon.com.....they got 80 $ from me, which means I saved 10 $.\n\nIndigo got 0$ and probably will not get anything for me in quite a while"
0,"I have just finished dinner at Romero euro cafe and I am extremely disappointed. It looked appealing from the outside and we were seated very quickly, however the remainder of our experience went downhill from there. First of all, the menu was overwhelming; at least 30 different entrees and 20 separate appetizers. This should have been a clue regarding the quality of the dishes.  Nevertheless, we ordered 2 appetizers which took over 30 minutes to arrive and then our entrees followed in about five minutes. If the food had been spectacular, or even edible, the timing would have been forgiven. However, I truly believe that due to the large menu and quick turn around time that most of the meals were either pre-made or frozen. Even the manicotti was unappetizing and could not be eaten. When we asked for Parmesan cheese, we were told it would be an extra 1:50 charge. We left our meals untouched and the waiter did not look surprised. It was a waste of money and I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Save yourself, your cash and your stomachs and frequent one of the excellent places across the street."
1,"The Acai bowls here are absolutely delicious- the healthy part is a big plus! I'm usually more of a carnivore, but the bowls here taste great. It can take some time to make the bowls, so I would always recommend calling ahead on your way in. The flavors are all excellent, and I'm a big fan of the original, go green, and peanut butter (my favorite) flavors.\n\nIf you haven't tried one yet, you should give it a chance!"
1,"If there ever was such a place as breakfast paradise, it would be Bouchon. Even the foodie wanderlust would stop for awhile. The food is worthy of the most finicky epicures. In laymens terms: it is so f*ing good. I thinketh most Yelpers would agree with the pages upon pages of reviews for this place.\n\nIt's a beautiful restaurant located inside the Venetian. The food here is lovely and well-presented. The flavor, texture, consistency of a Croque madame? Spot on. A \""Ham and cheese sandwich\"" never tasted better. It just melts in your mouth... \n\nDon't forget to keep an eye on the daily specials. The lobster bisque is not usually on the menu, but the flavor is amazingly good. Great zing! \n\nI usually drink black coffee to be in touch with the flavor of the coffee bean. And I must say, the coffee served here is quite robust and delicious.\n\nThis place is a definite Vegas-MUST. I try my best to stop by here each time I'm in town.."
1,"Have enjoyed your theater many times and certainly would attend more often if it were not for the great distance.  We live in Sun City West and would really like to suggest some thought to opening a theater in that northwest vicinity.   With the communities of Sun City, Sun City West, Sun City Grand and Surprise, I believe the attendance level would be excellent.   Meanwhile we shall continue to visit the Tempe location whenever possible.  Thank you."
0,"This place is great for last minute things when going out for a weekend adventure but it's not the size of the store or the selection they offer that bothers me about this location...it's the lack of customer service. I've been into this store multiple times and have never been acknowledged. No \""hello\"" or \""can I help you find something?\"" I've been in, looked for what I wanted, waited for assistance, and have walked out every time without making a purchase or speaking to an employee. That's not good customer service....anywhere."
1,"I normally don't prefer to eat at chains (though I will on occasion), but this one holds a special place for me. I'd just driven into Phoenix on a Wednesday afternoon, after a long drive across the country. Earlier in the day I'd signed the lease on my apartment and confirmed with the movers when they were coming the next morning. \n\nSo this tired chick hopped on Yelp to find some food -- nearby, familiar, and good enough. I found this Applebee's not too far away and also in the same parking lot as Target (killing two birds with one stone). It was my first meal here, since all of my belongings (read: pots, pans, cooking utensils) were on an 18-wheeler somewhere in the vast Phoenix metropolis. The people here were friendly enough, and I like their \""550\"" menu of dishes fewer than 550 calories. \n\nSo while I've grown fond of finding and frequenting locally-owned joints, on occasion I do hit a chain. This one was there for a very tired chick who needed some hot food and a nearby Target!"
0,"I probably won't return. I've been noticing these chains popping up all over the Dane County area and decided to stop by for lunch with a co worker while I was in Sun Prairie.\n\nWhat I like is that as soon as you walk in, you're greeted by someone who helped you with the process if you're a first timer. This is very different from other sandwich places. You go up to a station where all of their sandwiches are written in bags. So if you want a turkey sandwich, you crab the brown paper bag that has written in the back all of the turkey options they have. They do the same for beef, tuna, veggie, chicken, etc. You grab the bag of the sandwich you want and on the bag, you mark with a provided sharpie all of the toppings you want. This is a really neat idea. I liked the selection process. When you've marked your bag with all of your toppings, which they do provided a lot of choices I must admit, you take the bag to the register to pay and the bag is sent to sandwich artist. They put the finished sandwich in the same bag with your selections. Again, very cool idea. When're sandwich is done, they call you by name. There is a place on the bag for you to put your name down. \n\n\nHowever, they are overpriced for their quality of food. You get to pick from three different bread sizes, 6, 10.5 and 14 inches. For a 10.5 inch, it's $8.25 if you don't add toppings that are priced extra.   The sandwich was just OK. Nothing special. They gave me the wrong mustard but it wasn't a huge deal. My biggest issue is that there isn't any combo special. At least that is not what was told to me. For a 10.5 inch sandwich with not extra priced toppings and a small bag of chips, it was over $10. Had I added a pop, I would have been close to $12. It's a lot of money for a sandwich that's very basic and some chips. If the sandwiches were gourmet or other products were locally made, I totally could see the justification of price. However, the sandwich was just basic.  I prefer Quiznos or Pot Bellys over Which Wich to be honest. I had a lot of toppings on mines, but my sandwich was overwhelmed with mayor and horseradish. I couldn't even taste the other toppings. \n\nDoubtful i'd return. They aren't  terribly bad but they are far from greatness. The experience of picking your sandwich is cool but that's really the only positive I have from my first time experience. I can at least day I tried it and seen what they had to offer. Now I know and I won't be returning. I've had better sandwiches elsewhere."
0,"I really wanted to give them a more positve review as they are part of local trade association. Representative came out at the appointed time. I told him my budget was limited and was looking for a repair in leiu of a new door...Took one look at the door, said it could not be repaired. Wrote out an estimate $750.00 for an uninsillated door and 950 for an insilatted door..put it in my hand..said let us know and walked away..no discussion, nothing...............this was in a matter of probably 5 min max..Oh he did say no charge for the home call.................gee thanks...."
1,"This place brings back memories of my childhood in Korea. I love how they decorated the place! The food is also great! My favorite dishes are cheese chicken katsu, bosam and ramen dukboki. I also love drinking their yogurt soju!! MUST TRY EVERYONE!"
1,"First impressions are the most important.\n\nI am so glad I stopped by this location. The lady that runs the front counter is so freaking funny.\n\nI didn't know what to order when I got there. I saw Italian sausage and I just went for it. \nIt comes with marinara sauce, onions, and bell peppers. \n\nThe subs are above average they definitely have a better taste and the onions were so freaking good. \n\nThe location is very clean attached to a 7-11."
1,"Awesome little venue! Just saw Interpol here over the weekend and was very pleased.  My boyfriend and I traveled from San Diego just to see Interpol here so I was very concerned about the reviews for this place.  But I was pleasantly surprised to see that most of it seems to be from people who must not be used to this kind of atmosphere. \n\nIt is definitely a grunge kind of atmosphere.  It isn't dirty nor clean, strict nor lax. Mind you, it was an Interpol show I went to, so I don't think they were really expecting strung out head bangers or anything, but we were all patted down and asked to clear out our pockets.  No big deal.\n\nBut I was happy with the responsiveness of the security. There was a drunk chick next to my boyfriend and I that was being loud, crude, and violent and within 15min she was escourted outside. We were very appreciative. \n\nDespite the distance from our home, my boyfriend and I will definitely be going back.  A road trip is always a good break and this is an awesome destination."
1,My personal favorite for Mexican food.  Consider giving this a four star as the soda here is horrible at best.\n\nThe beans are great as is the rice.  I love the enchiladas and the spicy chicken is also very good.
0,"The Bellagio was sadly a bit disappointing. I was in town for a trade show event in July and found the hotel overcrowded and nearly impossible to navigate during the day. A \""quick\"" bite to eat took nearly 1.5 hours at a 2 p.m. lunch. Service was slow and lacking all over the resort.\n\nWhen I checked into my room, there was a massive clump of hair in the bathroom sink. Disgusting. I've staying in all kinds of hotels all over the world from two to five stars and have to say I've never seen a dirtier bathroom.\n\nWe had an unfortunate incident where a colleague had to have emergency surgery while on our trip. A horrible incident anywhere, but especially when one has to spend hours in a Las Vegas ER. When I called the hotel desk in the morning to ask for a late checkout so we could visit our friend in the hospital and get her returned to her hotel. We needed to make sure she was comfortable and all arrangement were made for her family to arrive before we caught a flight out of the city that afternoon. I was informed that it would only be possible if we paid a 1/2 day rate of $70+ dollars. How unfortunate that a hotel of this supposed caliber can't accommodate a guest in their city with this type of request. Especially since our flight schedules meant that we would be on our way to the airport by 3 p.m. at the latest.\n \nThe casino staff was lovely and the hotel was ok but certainly not deserving of a AAA five diamond. When I return to Vegas, I think I'll be staying at the Wynn. \n\nSorry, Bellagio, I had higher hopes."
0,Wow if I could give this place a big fat 0 I would. HORRIBLE. They were out of some of the bread for their sandwiches. Imagine a bakery that is out of bread. We also ordered their featured seasonal soup. Guess what? They were out of it.  Food not worth the price. Don't go.
1,"I just had a brunch at this place this morning.  My husband had the cassoulet and was very happy with it; hot until the end, very good portion, have everything he likes- potato, egg, mushroom, bacon...  I had the breakfast burrito.  It was very good - anything has Mexican name, I usually avoid it in Montreal but it was surprisingly good.  I might try Huevos Rancheros next time :)  \n\n Good brunch choices, fast service, nice take-out box, good coffee, decent hot chocolate, and close to my apt.  My  husband and I will go back definitely to try other food.  This might be it for our brunch spot!"
1,"I've been to 7th Heaven twice. The first time, there was a teenage girl working who dismissively said \""hi\"" to me and that was it. I was looking at shoes, which they have to get your size for you out of a closet, and she never once asked if she could help me. Terrible. I avoided the place after that.\n\nI went back last week as a last ditch effort since Fascinations had nothing for shoes, and Tiffany was working. She was super, super sweet and helpful. She dug through the closet multiple times for me (I'm extremely picky... so sue me), and upon not finding my size in a style I liked, suggested I at least try one size up in one of the brands; tada, they fit! Woohoo! She was even genuinely happy that they fit and that I could leave with a pair of shoes.\n\nAs Kelly said, they do give 15% off for dancers and offer a shoe warranty for $4, where they'll repair your soles or heels. This is a steal since shoes are $50+ and the soles often wear out in 6 months, and unless you looooove blisters, who really wants to buy a new pair and have to break them in all over again? \n\nMinus one star only because they have kind of a limited selection of dresses and like everywhere else, are usually out of stock on 7/8/9s in shoes."
0,Randomly pick a Asian to remove from the club. Can't believe this
1,We visited before the Royal Rumble - with such a packed place we were waited on quickly and the staff was very attentive to our needs.  We had a large group of people and it was a great time.  The food was good and the beer was reasonably priced.  It is a definite spot to go to before games/events or for a good meal.  Our waiters Matt and Nick were awesome and Casey took great care of us!  I would recommend it and plan on going back soon!
1,"Great beer selection, especially the beer fusions. Nice atmosphere, friendly staff, quick service. Food is typical bar food, nothing special but didn't agree with my girlfriends stomach in the least. So four stars for the beer and atmosphere but wouldn't eat here."
0,"It must have been an off night, but my wings were horrible.  We ordered several different flavors and they were all bland and greasy.  The temperature at the place must have been over 80' and the decor looked worn down like our waitress."
1,"This location recently opened back up under new management, which is great for me. It is right on the way home and cheaper than some of the other dry cleaners in my area. Wednesday I dropped off some clothes for pick up Wednesday - including my attire for the Yelp Event @ Switch, so I needed to get them. I was nervous when the lady told me that I had a gift certificate for some reason. With dry cleaners that typically means something was damaged and here is a small token of empathy. She said she wasn't sure what the gift certificate was for...nervously I looked over the items and no notes about damaged articles...no missing pieces. I took the $10 certificate and went home.\n\nSoon after I arrived home I noticed I missed a phone call. It was the manager of the cleaners calling to explain the gift certificate. Nothing was wrong with the service. He stated that a few of my shirts were 100% cotton and he did dry clean them as requested; however, those shirts would be better laundered with a bit of starch. The gift certificate was for me to come back and have those shirts laundered on the store's dime. \n\nFirst, he didn't have to give a gift certificate - he completed the order as requested. Secondly, he didn't have to take the time to call and explain the certificate and the reasons behind it.  I will gladly accept this paper gift certificate in the amount of $10 and return future business to this location!\n\nThat is customer service, and it is rare today."
1,"This small kitchen has some great food from amazingly good burgers to healthy stuff like fruit bowls and salads. They serve a good breakfast and lunch yet I haven't tried the dinner yet. Try them out, it's worth it."
0,"The first time I went here it was AWESOME and then sadly the next two visits have deteriorated into a two-star rating.  What happened, Pancake Cafe??  You keep getting voted best breakfast in Madison, but the change in quality from early spring 2011 to winter 2011 is utterly ridiculous.  The first time we went, my boyfriend had the corned beef hash and raved about it.  This past visit, he could barely choke it down it was so bland and salty.  Same story for the eggs benedict, with a very bland hollandaise sauce.  I wish it had kept the up the same quality we experienced in the spring, but after this third visit, I'm over it.  Average breakfast at best!"
0,"10-4-2013 1700 (5pm) Friday\n8 people in the restaurant. Was placed at a table and immediately noticed the table was filthy, look around and others in the same shape. Not dishes, food residue on the table. Ask busboy to clean uses a very wet cloth a couple of swipes and leaves the table wet. Mad because he had to do his job. Ordered Calamari fish was not cooked. Ordered sashimi dinner salmon was very old tried to cover it up with lemon slices. While I was eating the chef started some fish in the salamander about two minutes, then was told wrong order so he pulled out laid it on the back counter. A little later chef put it back in salamander and served it to someone else. There is food on walls, food on chairs, fish not stored at proper temperatures. Pre made starters wrapped in Saran Wrap about ten out in the open on the back of counter. I was up half the night with bowl problems. \nThe worst thing about this experience, I have been going there since it opened. This OWNER takes, but doesn't put anything back into the business. It is very popular, but someone is going to get very sick.\nCity and county FOOD inspectors  need to come inspect now."
0,"When visit the famous Las Vegas, the price for dinner at a restaurant mean at least over $100. However i think this newly open restaurant doesn't know that overrated prices must come with satisfactory service. Well this place had the most horrible service in a Restaurant in Vegas. It took 30 min to sit us down, 30 min to ask us for our order and another 30 min to bring the food. Not many options on the menu ( 6 options). We order the schiacciatta pizza, a medium size entree with a salad.  I think I would say that pizza from Costco Warehouse would taste better. I visit Las Vegas several times a year so I won't come back to that restaurant."
0,"I came into a wealth of free bagel & cream cheese bagel coupons, so I finally got a chance to check this place out.  I'm usually not big on chain bagels, but I'm not going to turn down a free meal either.  I tried to go once before but they close at 5pm on Sundays.  The sign on the door is lightly confusing since it used to read 6 but the bottom left-hand corner of the 6 was obfuscated in order to make it appear as though it was a 5. \n\nI finally made it last week and had a whole wheat bagel with jalapeno cream cheese.  The bagel was on par with the standard bagel you can get out of a bag at the supermarket.  The jalapeno cheese was delicious and the highpoint of the meal. The people working there were friendly and accommodating.  The main hangup was that the worker didn't offer to toast my bagel and, me thinking this would be standard didn't ask, left me with a pretty difficult to eat bagel.  After I took one bite I really needed my water to wash down the dense bagel.  In NYC you could probably eat untoasted bagels since they are really light and fluffy, but this one was a bit tough to swallow.\n\nI feel a conflict of interest when giving them only 2 stars since my bagel was free, but it'll have to remain at 2 until I get my next bagel (also gratis) before the coupon expires."
1,"Local restaurant, really small... Owner is the chef... Really funny and nice guy. Very authentic!"
1,Hotel was extremely accommodating and the staff was very helpful. The airline lost our tickets after wed checked out and the next flight wasn't for 8 hours. Not only did they send a shuttle to pick us up bit they also let us check back into our room.
1,It's a Whole Foods. They are all the same! Which isn't a bad thing for Whole Foods considering the awesome food and product selection!
1,"This is so much fun! The trucks line a square around the picnic area and everyone chooses where they want to it. I really dig it. The picnic area is swamp-cooler-ed down and it's an enjoyable atmosphere. Everyone from hood rats to high business rollers show up and it's like a little Lion King-esque watering hole, if you will. \n\nMust try it at least once!"

1,"This is a pleasant replica of a French style village. The architecture is not as outlandish as some of the other malls on the strip. My wife and I were on a hunt for a sweet tooth-pleasing experience. We found it at JJ's Boulangerie. They sell a variety of pastries and gelato flavors. I noticed they have sandwichs also if you want to do lunch. FYI, the gelato was probably best price at this location. It was $4 a scoop as opposed to 6 or 7 at the Ceasars Forum Shops. \n\nThe shops were nice and facility was clean. It does connect the Paris to the Bally's casino floor."
0,I'm not entirely happy with going to this place this time around. Service was awful and had to get the waitress' attention just to ask for something. The food was tasty at the time but now my stomach hurts. I wonder if they even got an A from the health department.
0,"If I could travel back in time 30 minutes, I would just so I could punch myself in the face for opting to try this place.\n\nFor starters, this is NOT a coffee shop.  While they are trying to angel themselves as such, they fail in that attempt.  Their failure really isn't any surprise, as the coffee menu was very limited and the girl behind the counter clearly wasn't a barista.  \n\nI ordered a latte, for lack of my normal (seemingly generic) mocha being on the menu.  After 10 minutes, I finally got it only to have it taste like what I assume old engine oil tastes like.\n\nThey also fail at being a bakery.  I don't want to be too harsh, but if I wanted a Fry's croissant, I'd go to Fry's.  They have a very limited bakery selection with their display having little more than a few cookies.\n\nI will give them credit that their prices are cheap.  I also give the girl behind the counter credit.  She was having to wear 4 hats at once.  She worked hard and was very nice.  And they do have a lot of space.  But I really can't see myself going back, which is sad because there aren't a lot of independent coffee shops in this part of Chandler."

0,"Worst experience ever.\nMy boyfriend and I went to BevMo on 12/22/14 to buy everclear for the holidays. They had the higher proof version (190) for the same price as the 151 at Total Wine, so we were stoked! Unfortunately after we went through the check out process, they decided to not sell the alcohol to us, due to one of us only having a vertical drivers license as an ID. We're both well over the age limit to buy alcohol, but they refused the sale to either one of us. \nThe total was originally $21, they placed a $30 hold on my card and today I find out that Bevmo POSTED THE CHARGE TO MY CARD. THEY HAD TO CANCEL/VOID THE SALE. SO NOW, RIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS, WE'RE OUT THE $30. \nI'm still in shock over how terrible of a business this is.\nUnethical treatment, and stealing of people's hard earned money is no way to run a business. AVOID AT ALL COST!\n\nAdditionally, Fry's Food and Drug carries the 190 Everclear for $2 less than BevMo (just to give you another reason to never go there again.)\nHere's hoping I saved someone the hassle of dealing with this dishonest merchant."
0,website is down....  cannot make contact with the business!  please fix your website so that I can get accurate contact info and other info from your website!  I would really like my dogs to stay there!  Thanks!
1,I really love this store! This pet store really cares about customer service to the fullest. I was interested in a certain flavor of Nature's Variety in the medium size bag and they only had Lamb and Oatmeal in the smaller bag. Because they pride themselves on customer service they discounted the smaller bag for me because of the inconvenience and ordered me the medium bag that they are also giving me a discount on. I THINK THAT IS AWESOME! They also donate any returned bags of food the the animal shelter and I think that is pretty amazing :)
1,"First off, Luedtke's Wonder Bar is in the same location as the previous establishment known as \""The Bar Next Door\"". The decor is much the same...but that is where the comparison ends. \n\nI will always prefer to spend my dollar at a small business vs. a chain. I respect what it takes to make good food and make it consistently when you are working from scratch every day. For reference, some of my favorite spots in Madison are Otto's, Louisianne's, and The Tornado Room. Luedtke's Wonder Bar is a notch above that dynamic trio if you can believe it. \n\nI have dined at Luedtke's Wonder Bar twice in the last two months. The latest meal being this last Friday night. I had seared tuna as an appetizer. The tuna was fantastic. The next thing I had was the crab bisque. I am not sure if this is on the menu every night but the two times I have been there, that has been the soup...Let me just say if it isn't on the menu every night, it should be! My goodness that is a great tasting soup. For my main dish I had a 9 oz fillet and garlic mash. The fillet had the consistency of sushi grade tuna. It was full of flavor and practically melted in my mouth. My only regret was that I didn't order the 12 oz! My wife had a crusted halibut fillet which she proclaimed was the best food she had ever had in a restaurant. That is high praise coming from her. \n\nSo, the food is definitely 5 star, the atmosphere is quaint and cozy, the wine selection is nice and the prices are definitely in-line with what you get for the money. \n\nHat's off Mr. Luedtke, we will certainly be back!"
0,"Oh I am spoiled with the small-town feel of Tucson International--now if they wold only get some quality flights!!\nI've never flown out of Sky Harbor.  Seems like any other large-scale airport on the surface.\nSo why only two stars?  The driving around to find where to park is horrible.  They need to remember that most people don't frequent the airport.  So they should be obvious and deliberate with the signage.  \nAlso, the elevator from the parking garage to the terminals is a little confusing.  It literally went from floor 3, to 2, to B, to A, to 1.  Alpha-numerics embedded within themselves?  Again, keep it simple for us dummies who don't live the commuter jet-set lifestyle."
1,"I am a pretty handy person with do it yourself tasks, but when it comes to pool care, I am a fish out of water.\n\nFor the the 5+ years l lived in Arizona, Desert Sparkle kept my pool in perfect condition.  I supplied chlorine tablets, and they handled everything else.  Thanks to Steve, who provided the weekly service, the only thing I had to consider when it came to my pool was which bathing suit to wear.  He kept me aware of any issues with the equipment, and even made friends with my dog.  :)\n\nIn addition to the weekly pool service, Desert Sparkle handled the annual maintenance of my DE filter as well as any other repairs that came up.  When my pool vacuum started to have issues, they provided me with a loaner unit until I could get a replacement.  Pool vacuums aren't inexpensive, and they provided recommendations on which units were the best in terms of performance and value, which I appreciated.\n\nWhen I moved out of state and my house was on the market for sale, I knew I did not have to worry about my pool continuing to look perfect.  Since my home was vacant, Steve even put a wire tie on my back gate latch to discourage anyone from paying an unwelcome visit to my back yard.  Nice to know someone was looking out for me!\n\nOverall I was very impressed with the service provided by Desert Sparkle.  If you are looking for honest, reliable pool care, give them a call!"
1,"I've now made three trips to Lobby's.  The first was an enormous disappointment, the last two have been exceptional.\n\nOn my first trip, I made the mistake of ordering the Italian beef sandwich.  What I received could best be described as a thinly-sliced beef sandwich on a baguette that some jerk spilled soup on.  My sandwich was soggy to the point of disintegration from the moment I received it.  I tend to be a very neat eater, but felt I needed a bib that day.  In addition to the mess, the whole assemblage was bland and unremarkable.  \n\nHowever...\n\nI'd happily recommend Lobby's to anyone who wants a burger.  Upon hearing great things about their hamburgers, I returned to Lobby on two more occcasions.  On both days, I got a ridiculously large, juicy burger with great quality beef and fresh ingredients for a price around half of their competitors (I'm looking at you, Smashburger and Five Guys).  \n\nSo, go for the burgers and read the menu carefully: the single patty burger is 1/3 pound.  If you order the double, you're ordering more than a half-pound of beef and you will need a nap."
0,"Buyer beware.  Took advantage of the New Years special this evening, (buy one Delmonico steak between 9-10pm and get the second one for free).  Upon explaining to our waiter that we wanted to take advantage of their \""advertised special\"" in the AZ Central dining deals from AZ Republic that had been advertised since December 21st on this website,we were informed he was not aware of such special.  Upon which my date and I felt totally embarrassed as I didn't want to look like I was just trying to get something for nothing.  He checked with his manager and said \""they would honor it\"", a $28.99 value, but that it was the AZ central error.  From that point on our waiter was very short with us and made us feel like we're putting him out because he wasn't going to make as much in tips from us.  \n\nThis couldn't be further from the truth, as all items were alacarte and with wine it actually came out to more than if we had ordered steaks alone.  The steaks by the way were excellent, but the tone for the evening with the poor service didn't make up for the taste and presentation of the food.  By the way, we overheard the couple in the booth behind us request the same special, but by that time the restaurant was aware that people would be comming in for the special.\n\nFinally to make matters worse, when we got bill for the two of us it had an automatic gratuity of 20% added to the bill.  When I explained to the waiter that this must be a mistake he explained that it was \""their policy\"" to add on this automatic charge whenever they have to \""give away food\"".  When I explained that I didn't feel comfortable in paying such a high mandatory amount, he immediately said he would get the manager and stormed off in a huff.\n\nManager Eric S. came over and supported his waiter by basically backing him up and not listening to our valid complaints.  He actually stormed off also when we told him we wanted to have him adjust the gratuity to what was a more fair assessment of service at 10-15%.  He came back and gave a half hearted apology for \""feeling threatened\"" when I told him I would let others know of their lousy customer service. So there you have it, It appears that their is an attitude at the Arrowhead grill is greater than though, and how dare we to complain.  Needless to say we will not ever be back though the food was good,not worth the hassle and a terrible New Years Eve meal ruined by their ineffective ability to act professional and with grace and understanding."
0,"I got a good deal on a Groupon for the new Quaker Steak & Lube so we stopped in for a late lunch last week.  There were only a few patrons in the restaurant at that time.  It was so slow, in fact, that it seemed that we were a bother to the hostess because she really couldn't seem less interested in seating us.  Thankfully, our server made up for her shortcomings, plus some.  He was fantastic.  Very attentive and very personable.\n\nIf only the food was as good as the service.  Ugh...such a let down!  I ordered Mild Wings.  The sauce was ok, but the skin was too soft.  My son got the Medium spiced wings and he said that they were ok, but that he's had better.  My husband ordered the Philly Cheesesteak and said it was acceptable.  Nothing special, but not terrible either.  He also got a small order of Cajun spiced boneless wings.  I tried them and the flavor was NOT appealing to me at all.  The one saving grace for the entire meal were the onion rings.  A tad too salty, but perfectly crispy and not greasy.  My son and I liked them very much.\n\nThe decor is a bit gaudy, but I'm fairly certain that's by design.  I'm glad that we were seated at a booth because the plastic lawn chairs at the standard tables would have been very uncomfortable.  The only downside to the booth was that I was a bit grossed out by how filthy the framed picture was that was hanging over our booth.  It looked like some kids smeared their dirty hands all over the picture.  Seriously, it was disgusting and it even had an odor.  And speaking of odors...there was an odor in the restaurant that reminded of me the remnants of water damage.  It was really off-putting.\n\nSo...it wasn't a good lunch at all and we won't be back.  It's a shame because the concept of the restaurant is cool and the menu \""looked\"" great."

0,"And now, upon moving out, they're hounding us for triple-digit  \""move-out\"" costs despite us having a maid service clean the place from top to bottom upon moving out.  According to the lease they're supposed to advise the tenants of when the move out inspection will be so the tenant can be present, but they didn't with us.  When I called them out on it, they claimed we \""gave up that right when we turned in our keys.\""  Both attorneys I spoke with said their claim and interpretation of the lease wouldn't hold up in court, and their assessed charges were illegitimate, but the cost to take them to court exceeded the amount they were charging so it wasn't really worth it.  CURRENT TENANTS:  DEMAND TO BE PRESENT AT YOUR MOVE-OUT WALK-THRU.  \n\nAnd their current property manager as of April 2013 is not pleasant to deal with.  She's more concerned with collecting money than working with tenants to solve problems... there are apartments north, south, east and west of this place...move into one of those, cause they can't get much worse than this place."
0,"Made reservations and still waited 15 minutes in the lobby awkwardly as no one was paying attention to us. This was my first time at the melting pot so I had no idea what to expect but after waiting and finally being seated we sat at the table for another 15 minutes before the waitress showed up and awkwardly/reluctantly introduced herself. Anyways, we got the new cheese fondue thing they had, and the coppa bean something rather. Not my favorite fondue or broth but the filet mignon was delicious regardless as was the ahi tuna.  All in all, I hope I will never have to go back, It just isn't my cup of tea apparently."
0,"I wish I would have found these reviews before I set up my account.  It seemed like  no matter how I set up my delivery request, the number of bottles I received didn't match my request.  After several months I happened to catch the driver who instructed me not to use either the website or the phone service to change my order, just leave him a note.  Why they provide the phone or website option is beyond me.  \n\nMore recently I've had trouble with my payments.  I had been paying my account online and all of a sudden it wasn't going through, but it looks like it's going through electronically and there's no email communication that says there is a problem.   I received a notice saying my account was on hold, so naturally I called and was told that the payments hadn't been going through because they were being applied to an old card.  I told the agent that I was really tired of the hassle and wanted to close my account.  She verified my card information, removed the old card from my account, and said they'd keep the account on hold until I was done with the last two bottles.  Imagine my surprise when I get another bill a month later with a late fee.    I called and was told that I must not have asked the agent to actually charge my account.  She confirmed the correct card number and deleted the old card but didn't bother to process my payment at that time.  Of course I was notified that this was my error.  Unfortunately, the tape recordings of phone calls are only held for 2 weeks, so the customer is assumed to be wrong.    I think this is a great scheme to increase their revenue.   At least I learned from my mistake and got a confirmation from Brittany today.  \n\nI have a new service starting later this week.  I hope my experience with DS Waters is not a reflection of the industry!!"
0,"Not one but TWO times had to drive back around and give them back the food they handed me. Two times they gave me someone else's food! Every time I tried to check, they told me they were busy and that I needed to pull forward if I wanted to check. \n\nI just wanted to try their salad. \n\nEvery fast food restaurant has the ability to make a decision: are you going to be as bad as everyone expects, or are you going to take the time to do it right?\n\nWendy's of 301 E Indian School, I hope you read this. Moreover, I hope you try harder to take the time to do it right. I believe in you."

0,"Service here was a total nightmare.  I'm pretty sure management is comprised of a herd of cats because everything was chaos.\n\nAlthough I was seated at a table, and had food brought to me, I still have no idea who my server was.  There was a guy with an iPhone that took our order...but mysteriously disappeared.  Then the bartender ended up taking our order after we had to ask for our order to be taken.  Just, service misery. Keep dreamin' if you want water refilled.  The whole meal was spent tracking down employees to perform basic tasks. \n\nFood was okay (blue crab, lobster roll, nothing special) and the restaurant was clean -- the only things saving this place from 1 star.  Not worth it, however, to endure round 2 of this service mess."
1,"We love Mei Wei.  We often go for lunch- it is delicious and includes soup, salad, egg roll, rice and main dish for a very reasonable price.  The staff is super friendly.  We have done take out via delivery and were really pleased.  I would recommend you try this tiny,  quaint little restaurant- the food is delicious and the staff are great."
0,"I am not proud to admit this, but I always feel nasty after eating here. Don't get me wrong the place is kept clean, the staff looks presentable,  but my food is always so greasy! It's fast 'Amerexican' (American + Mexican) food at its best. Order the carne asada burrito with guac and sour cream and you'll be set for awhile on your 'Amerexican' fix. \n\nStop by their salsa bar too and pick up some red sauce - it's probably the only reason I come here once in a blue moon."
0,"Run... don't walk away from this marathon.       The start is terrible as you navigate through two miles of walkers because there is no organization in the corrals.  The fun of running the Vegas strip is there for the first few miles and then you are out in the desert with little lighting, poorly marked miles (they could have lit them -- It's Vegas baby).  Don't expect it any better at the end where the narrow lanes on slanted broken up black top made for a dangerous finish where you could not accelerate and you are sharing the path with the 4 hour pace half marathon participants (visualize meeting the walkers you dealt with at the start now making the finish path more narrow as they walk into the end of their race).  The chute after the finish was way too long with no mid point exits.   They could have shortened it up to allow more of the final run to take place on the strip instead of in the dark in the desert.    I ran Eau Claire Wisconsin (with ~200 runners this year) and NYC (with +50,000 runners in 2013) and both had better energy and NYC handled the crowds of runners much better.     I am not affiliated with Eau Claire in any way but for a good marathon with as many music stops as RNR and great community support head to Wisconsin..... no gambling but an amazing event and of course NYC is amazing.\n\nPros:   Running through  Freemont Experience (1/2 mile),  Checking Nevada off the list.\nCons:   Everything else.  Log jam of runners for first few miles, boring once you leave the strip (most of the route), poorly marked, not the safest last mile to the finish, too long a finishing chute after receiving medal.    Did I really pay that much for all this?\n\nIf you have to do this race it is flat and will not challenge you too much so enjoy that part of it."
0,"I love sephora, but my experience in this store makes me want to only shop online. I walked through the whole store and not one employee greeted me or asked if I needed assistance. And when I did have a question no one was around to help. I saw one employee not assisting anyone, but she avoided eye contact and appeared busy fixing products on the shelf. I left the store after that and I probably will not return."
1,"The wife and I frequent this amazing place regularly. Most of the time we head in there for lunch as they have an early bird offer of, 2 courses for \u00a311 or 3 courses for \u00a314!\n\nThe last time we were there I had the, Red wine braised ox cheek pithivier,\nHornig's black pudding, red wine jus for a starter and the fish and chips for a main. Both were excellent. \n\nService has always been good with only the odd long wait for the bill when they are very busy. I always ask for the bill as they collect the dessert plates to speed this up.\n\nSo, just how good is this place? Well..... I have made the suggestion to the waitress that they build a private plate licking room so that diners can lick the plates clean without everyone thinking they are nuts!\n\nOne word of warning. They no longer accept American Express."
1,"Five stars coz there isn't anything higher than that!  Excellent food,  very professional service and perfect ambience.  Best place for Indian chinese food hands down!  We drive all the way from Gilbert for this food!  Great job!  Love their veg coin manchurian and lat mai paneer!"
1,"I can't believe I have not reviewed Gymboree! We have been attending classes here for over a year, and my child looks forward to them each and every week. The staff is seasoned and knows how to include all the children (shy, rambunctiousetc.) in a positive and safe environment. The recent remodel of the facility is also nice.\n\nMy only con would be some of the parents. Just like in any situation with families, some parents just don't get it. I have seen parents use it as social hour and not participate at all. I have also seen some parents watch as their child takes a toy from another child, knock another child down, etc. and do nothing. SIGH."
0,"Eh... I expected a lot better from what I've heard and after an hour wait...( I've been to the one in Asheville- and it's just not the same). I will say service was friendly (but slow), but the food just wasn't good.\nBrunch:\nI ordered a crab and egg dish- and after it took about 50 minutes to come out, it just wasn't good. It lacked flavor and spices, and was definitely not worth the $14. My husband got a meat pie after the server recommended it- also, not very impressive and not a lot of meat in it. \nAfter we were asked how the food was, we told our server that we weren't very happy with it, the manager came over and apologized and gave us a gift card to try again. At least they care... \nToo bad the food wasn't good..."
0,VERY disappointed. No ambiance. Ugly patio. Rude staff. The website menu shows a gluten free option but when I asked about it they seemed irritated. Food isn't great. Wine pours are small. This neighborhood needed a new restaurant/bar but this one isn't going to cut it.
0,First I was really excited to do this. I have done the Go-karts before in other cities and loved racing my friends. I got a great Groupon deal for Fast Lap (their is a reason they need a Groupon to get business). The place is looks like an abandoned warehouse that Meth addicts hang out behind. Was going great till their employees started spinning out the other patrons. Not the best fun time to have when you can't enjoy the race when the employees are jerks and spin you out. They did this to several people. I went to Pole Position near by and the place is more upscale with better customer service and nicer facilities. Seriously don't go not worth the Groupon price.
0,"A WORD OF CAUTION:  \nWhen I left the restaurant, I paid for my dinner with a credit card.  Two weeks later when I received my monthly credit card statement, I realized Havana Cafe did a DOUBLE CHARGE on the credit card!  I called, and initially accounting stated that it was not a double charge, \""that it just looked that way\"".  I called Visa, and the second charge was immediately removed. \nI spoke with the owner - she apologized and offered me a mere 15% discount on my next meal, which I thought was rather tacky.\nWord to the wise: examine your credit card statements, as Havana caf\u00e9 was not about to call me!"
1,"Came here to try it for the first time. Service was really nice and fast. Even helped cook our meat sometimes. We got the $15.95. All good cause it was pretty good stuff. The brisket is good. Salad is pretty good. I like the flavor. Steamed egg was tasty. Their rice is nice and hot. Marinated spicy chicken was unique and yummy. Kimchi was really good and cold. Water was always refilled quickly without asking. They know how to do work here! Got the check and was confused why it was more expensive than we thought. We just decided to pay for it anyways. When we went to the cashier I saw on the menu it said they automatically ass gratuity to all parties 5 or less 15% or more 18%. Then out loud I said \""oh babe that's why, they already charged us for gratuity.\"" She looked at us and looked concerned and I replied \""sorry it was our first time here.\"" And then she was quick to apologize and say \""oh I'm sorry I didn't know usually our customers know so we don't say anything..\"" And I said it was fine. She was really nice about it and I can tell it was a genuine response. The place is cute and clean too. Thumbs up to Korean garden! Now I know why people go here."
0,"I first went to Merry Ann's the night I craved The Home Stretch Haystack. Merry Ann's version paled in comparison. I gave them another shot a few weeks later, this time for lunch.  I ordered a blue plate special, country fried steak, mashed potatoes and gravy, and peas. The country fried steak patty was chopped formed, deep fried, and covered with a gravy dry mix, which also covered the potatoes. The peas were from a can. Haven't eaten there since."

0,"My son and I decided to go to Saddle Ranch before a Coyotes game to grab some appetizers and a beer. After placing our order, the waitress came back and informed me that since there was a Coyotes game, they were not honoring their Happy Hour prices. You're kidding! Let's take advantage of the people coming to Westgate for a sporting event. There are too many choices in Westgate that DO honor Happy Hour to ever return to Saddle Ranch."
1,"Not only are their bagels delicious, but they have THE BEST COFFEE in the valley, hands down.  Add a touch of cream and a little sweetener to their hazelnut vanilla brew or their breakfast blend for a slightly less sweeter version and it's practically HEAVEN in cup.  I'm not kidding.  I am a serious coffee drinker (couldn't tell ,could you?) and I am very picky.  So picky that before I discovered Lox, I would only drink the coffee that I made for myself at home because no one else's was good enough.  However, now that I have had the glorious coffee from Lox Stock & Bagel even my own coffee doesn't measure up.  I literally stop by and pick up a cup from there almost every day. YUMMMM!"
0,I went for dollar sushi and the service was horrible!!!! The waitress doesn't serve us drinks till about a minute before the food gets there (and thats that one of us only wanted water.) On top of that they didn't bother to look that we didn't have any chop sticks!! \n\nThe sushi was only ok for a dollar a piece. For all of that I might as well only get sushi from Siam Terrace where they have $5 sushi rolls (6 pieces).
1,"This is a small, no-nonsense creperie with a wide selection of items. I wanted to get something light and the associate at the counter was able to convert their Florentine Crepe into an omelet for me. The portion size was more than sufficient and the food tasted fresh. It's a great spot--very clean and they use compostable and recyclable cups, plates etc."
1,"La Tolteca is outstanding. Passing through PHX and a friend (and frequent visitor to AZ) told me I need to stop here. He spoke truth. \n\nGet the chilaquiles! Get them. \n\nWe also had tacos de papa, and caldo de camarones...the latter was awesome too, delicious broth and packed with shrimp. The salsa bar had grilled jalape\u00f1os & habanero salsa we couldn't get enough of. \n\nI'll be back to La Tolteca. Five stars no hesitation."

They were giving out samples of their pickles and a Pulled Pork BBQ Slider. \nThe Pickles were better, but still not crunchy or all that special. \nThe Slider however was really good. It had a good flavor, and was well made. While I may not like the pickles, I would order this again."
1,"The first time I saw this show, my jaw dropped from the moment the curtain magically disappeared into the theater.  Sounds strange, but I don't know how else to describe it.  It doesn't just go up like your standard stage curtain.  So don't be late!  Performers run across the stage one minute, and then next, someone is doing a high dive into the same area.  The staging of this show is pure art.  The set design is incredible.  True to Cirque du Soleil style, the costumes are amazing.  The talent of the performers are unmatched.  The music is hypnotic.  If you were to ever buy one of the CDs, you should consider 'O'.  We loved it so much, we actually used one of the pieces as my processional at our wedding.  When one of the performers 'plays' a piano solo while it gently descends into the pool, that was my moment.  Sigh...   \n\nUnfortunately, the price of the show is not cheap.  Last I checked, it went up to $150 per person.  But if you're going to splurge on a Vegas show, this one worth every penny.  The memories you will walk away with will be priceless."
0,Ugh this place is so overrated! It's cool that they cook in front of you and everything but the quality of the food is not great!!! I've been here twice for friends birthday dinners and I don't know why they like it here so much. The service is awful and everything is so overpriced!!! If I never go here again I would be fine with it but I bet one of my girlfriends will drag me here again

1,"If you want great New Orleans Style food at a great price off the Vegas Strip, this is a must. The place is near Fremont in quaint Bourbon St. like place playing Zydeco music. The Cajun cuisine is probably better than even Bourbon St. in New Orleans! The Gumbo appetizer was almost a meal with generous portions of shrimp. The Red Beans and Rice was huge and had plenty of sausage.  Staff were excellent and very friendly. I will definitely include this in my next visit."
1,"We went here last night for the first time and had a fantastic dinner. My husband ordered a spicy vegetable soup and we got two orders of chicken tikka masala. He didn't like his soup and said it tasted like spicy water with some spices, so we will try something different next time. The chicken tikka masala was AWESOME, but the rice it came with was pretty bland. Although I felt it was fine when paired with the masala. The garlic butter naan we ordered was seriously amazing! And dipping it in the tikka masala sauce was the best part of the meal. Our server was very sweet and very efficient, however they were definitely understaffed for the amount of people dining. I think she may have been serving most of the tables in the place. So it took a little longer to get everything than it probably should have but it was never so long that it was ridiculous. The restaurant itself is beautiful, very clean and well designed. You would never be able to know such a nice place is hidden in the shopping mall. There was plenty of open parking and it seemed like the place didn't get busy until 8:30ish; definitely a later crowd. Our price for the soup, two dinners, naan and 20% tip was $45; which was very reasonable. We will absolutely be back soon!"
1,"Don't know why the haters hate. The food here was good, and the only thing to criticize is that the heat is a bit weak \nOrder hotter than you normally would. \n\nHad the spicy basil chicken. Amazing. Opened with the original Tom Ka soup. Great flavor but ordered medium, it lacked heat. \n\nIt is relatively peaceful. Not by most standards, but certainly by Vegas standards. \n\nBest compliment I can give it is that I'd eat there again."
1,My Sunday ritual consists of sauntering into this establishment and doing the city paper crossword (in pen and I can't spell). Bummed they cut back the brunch menu but it is still a clutch brunch spot (and it's safely away from the masses lined up outside of Pamela eagerly waiting to get their fix of butter soaked everything with a side of afternoon diarrhea).
1,"I had very high expectations before watching this show because all my friends highly praised it. AND the show did not fail me! I loved the choreography, the stage and the costumes. My favorites are always the clowns, too adorable and funny. A must watch show in Vegas!"
1,Uhhhh yum! It's Spinatos!! Been coming for years! The pizza is the bomb! I pretty sure it's in the sauce! The pizza is a thicker Chicago style pizza and it's soooo good! The caesar salad is great too! The place is cute and small and the staff is friendly and attentive!  A must for Phoenix!
1,"First line to pay then second lines to wait to be seated. Weekday around 11:30 pay line was longer than the seating line. \n\nThings I liked @ brunch:\nSmoked salmon with capers and cucumbers good portion and yummy\nAngry Mac and cheese, angry bc of the hint of spice.\nKorean BBQ ribs-a bit tough to cut with a butter knife but the flavor was delicious\nThick cut slab bacon at the carving station\nGelato- delicious salted caramel and tiramisu. \nHomemade marshmellows, soft fluffy goodness\nMini apple crumble pie tarts\nBalanced sweetness of warm French toast\nCocktail shrimp- stock up on these single shooters \nCheesecake with raspberries on top was yummy perfect texture and richness\n\nThings to avoid:\nGreen curry noodles in the take out box. Awful! Blan fettuccine like noodles with tasteless green paste.\nEggs Benedict the sauce tasted like a package mix. My egg was runny and fine but the bf's was solid.\nsushi- minuscule and lacking any sort of real fish. The imitation crab wasn't even good.\nstrawberry short cake- bland tasteless best thing was just the strawberry on top. \n \nOverall good, I enjoyed the food that I tried and there were enough things that I wasn't stuck with just two favorite dishes. Much better than othe buffets I believe for the price and quality. \n\nP.s. I didn't notice many people tipping and over heard some servers complaining about it. I get that it's a buffet and you're getting your own food, but people don't forget to tip at least a few bucks for those who are bringing you drinks and clearing off those tables.\n\nI had a mimosa and asked for a coke and tea, and of coursed tipped a few bucks to our server."
1,"Friendly service. Huge portions for our reasonably priced meal. No problems accommodating our party of 6. Our party had antipasta, wings, pizza & Stromboli. Everyone was happy with their meal. Would recommend."
1,"So I know my past review was a little rough, but my second and definitely short visit was able to calm my senses. This company really strives to make sure that their customer satisfaction is truly guaranteed. The owner, Brooke, is super nice and addressed my concerns in such a kind manner. I happened to have time to stop by today for some pineapple whip and she wasn't there but I thought I would give it a try anyway. The guy ended up being another owner, her husband, and he was very friendly and knew about my situation because she spoke with him about it! They definitely didn't treat me differently because of my bad review, but they just understood where I was coming from. It seemed to have been an error with Groupon's company so I'm currently trying to get that fixed at the moment! For now, he offered me some whip and I was such a happy happy camper. Once again, texture was perfect and flavor was on point! Their menu was different than the first time I came and it was written on a chalk board! Really cute! He said they're adding more things to the menu and spicy-ing the place up a bit so I'm looking forward to the new changes. They definitely have an awesome lil shop and what I've had so far is great. I can't wait to keep coming back and trying new things. Just wish they were closer to home! Truly my new go-to dessert stop. If you're in the area, you gotta try it."
0,I was there one a date and lost the opportunity to bed one of the cutest little French spinners you have ever seen over the service we received.  We waited an hour and a half for our stinky meatloaf.  Followed by our 30 minute wait for cheesecake.  I have to admit the food was actually good.  The problem is the little hot French spinner had a curfew.  She had promised me a great time.  We were late for curfew when we left the Restraunt.  Thanks a lot.  She got back with her boyfriend of 4 years the next week.  I could have been her mistake.
0,"I rarely complain even when receiving bad service. However, in this case the service I received (or rather didn't receive) was horrific!!!\nA few months ago, my mother traveled from overseas to visit my family and I for a 2 weeks. I purchased a room for her at this Days Inn well in advance and paid in full. We arrived to check in late in the day and were told that my mother's room is a smoking room. My mother suffers from a respiratory condition and when we walked into the room it was clear that she would not be able to stay in it. The room STANK and had a standing cloud of smoke. It was actually visible!!!\nWe went to the desk and asked to change the room. We were told that there is no other room. When we asked to speak with the manager we were told that she's unavailable. When we insisted the person at the desk finally called his manager on her cellular. Here's where it gets interesting...\nGina Padilla, the manager, began blaming me for the situation! Really? Here I was trying to figure out a solution for helping this establishment keep my $600 and am being blamed for not landing sooner in the day at the airport. I finally asked for a refund. Once again, demonstrating horrid customer service, I was refused!\nEventually, I stopped payment on the funds to the Days Inn and promised Gina Padilla that I would be writing this review. Maybe she can take notes on how to fulfill on a promise to render good service.\nDO NOT STAY HERE!!!!"
1,The place is a hit and miss. When super busy the food is a miss when there are no lineups the food is fantastic. \n\nThe bourbon lemonade is wonderful.  Lobster burrito is good.\n\nThe decor is great and atmosphere is wonderful.
1,"We went in January for dinner as my husband received a gift card. Yes, this place is pricey, but well worth it. The service is phenomenal. They even have bathroom attendants! \n\nMy husband got the bone-in filet and I got the king crab legs. He ordered the wedge salad and I had the chopped salad. We had the sugar snap peas and scalloped potatoes as sides. Even though he asked for the filet as medium, it came medium rare. He didn't mind. I had a bite and while it was very tender, I would have sent it back for more cooking. My king crab legs were fantastic. Perfectly cooked - not too salty or too watery. The sugar snap peas were crisp and the scalloped potatoes were very rich. \n\nOur server was spot on until we finished our meal. She was being attentive to a large table, but we were ignored for a good 10-15 minutes once our entree dishes were cleared. This is the reason I didn't give 5 stars. \n\nI think this is a great place to go for a special occasion dinner. We're not the only ones who think that because the restaurant was packed in early January."
0,"Absolutely unimpressive place. Came here due to the myriad of 5-star reviews. Drove twice around the carpark before realising this place is literally INSIDE the Lee Lee market, and there is NO sign, not even a sandwich board, indicating this on the outside! Went in and got seated immediately. Water brought out quick. Orders taken and served quick. That's where the delight ended. They didn't have the fresh coconut that I normally get so that was disappointing.  My \""large\"" pho was ok, but I wouldn't classify it as a large. Maybe a medium. Broth tasted ok. Hardly any of the sliced beef balls or tripe, or in fact much meat at all. Small handful of bean sprouts and a single tiny lime slice provided. My kid had the crepe with bean sprouts, shrimp and pork. Yuck. I had some - the crepe tasted bland and ten minutes later, cold (my kid tried his best to delay actually eating any, can't blame him), I wouldn't have served it to a dog. Wife thought her vermicelli and BBQ pork was okay and liked the \""fresh\"" taste, but thank god the fish sauce was on the side. Ugh. Absolutely NO table service after we'd started, not even offers to refill water. Had to get up and walk around to the tiny cash register to pay. Got back to table and sat down to wait for the kid to strangle down another couple of bites and that's when I had an ice water jug held in front of me as a refill offer. Nope, done.\n\nThis place is nowhere near as efficient or generous with their portions as either Pho Thanh (Camelback) or Da Vang (19th Ave). Those who think the prices are cheap need to understand that those prices are normal for a viet place. They're all this cheap, except the ridiculously-overpriced Rice Paper on 7th Ave. Go to Pho Thanh (http://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-thanh-phoenix), order the large pho dac biet for $6.75 and run a comparison of what you get.\n\nI wouldn't go back here."
1,"They are always friendly at this McDonald's.  My husband loves the Chocolate Chip Frappe and one time they made this incorrectly, but we were already several miles away.  I called them back and said the Frappe didn't taste correct.  We went back and they made another one for us free of charge and we got to keep the one that didn't taste quite as sweet.\n\nThis McDonald's is very inviting, clean, with a large children's play area, TV sets.  Sometimes service inside is a bit slow, but if we go inside, we are not in a hurry.  They usually get our order correct at the drive-thru.\n\nI just wished they had the Hot n'Spicy McChicken still on the dollar menu, as my husband likes that."
1,Kevin installed sun screens on my kids' bedroom windows.  He was always very polite and punctual in our conversations.  His prices were very competitive and the quality of the sun screens appears to be top notch.

0,"I came here with a couple of \""race\"" friends. I asked the guys letting us in what the waiting about 20 minutes in the front of the line problem was. They said we are trying to figure it out... I asked them multiple times what the problem was ...and they said we are trying to figure it out..... I will never go to Marquee again...They let multiple white girls in front of us.... They never let us in and I am a beautiful white woman with a couple of african-American friends. They definitely thought we were up to something.... Because of my friends' race. I am not happy and I will always talk shit on this place. I will never go here ever again .... I talked to the cops right next to the class... And they said they have the right to refuse anybody. WOW!!! Never go to COSMOPOLITAN."
0,"I do not recommend this place! I purchased groupon for the gel manicure and pedicure. I was defintely not satisfied. It was not worth the drive. In plus, they charged an extra five dollars for shellac, opi and other high quality nail polishes. That's ridiculous. On top of that, the pedicure sucks!"
1,"I have a home and a rental home in Las Vegas and BOTH homes needed to have new systems this summer. After getting estimates from the \""big boys\"" in the business, I called a real estate broker friend of mine and asked who he used for the 20 or so homes he owns in the valley. He says that Jeremy Davis with Your Air Conditioning and Heating is who he had been using for years and he had been most satisfied!!! That was good enough for me....so I called Jeremy and he went to both properties, assessed the situations, explained all my options to me and once I decided on the system (Trane), he got back to me with very professional proposals spelling out everything including warranty, etc. He gave me a discount for multiple properties, but \neven before discount, his price was significantly lower than the 5 estimates I had done by the \""big boys\"" in the business.  He is totally reliable, works right along beside his employees and goes beyond the call of duty to give the BEST service I have ever had!!!!  I am thrilled and I cannot believe that there is a review by Roger somebody that is so negative!!! There has to be something else going on here!!! If you need service for heating or cooling you would definitely be doing yourself a favor to give these people a call!!!"
1,"Not sure why people don't like this place in the reviews. \n\nIs it expensive? Yes, but no more do than its peers in the hotel-the convenience fee one pays in the strip. \n\nSince the wait staff were speaking Cantonese we stuck to the Hong Kong staples on the menu. Well prepared classics that of be happy with at any authentic Chinese restaurant. Not high end Hong Kong dining, but certainly not a hawkers market offering.  Definitely not the American food crap most Midwesterners mistakenly call Chinese food. \n\nCrispy Noodles were well seasoned and quite flavorful. BBQ pork was maybe a touch dry but still full of flavor. Siu Mai was a decent offering. Stir fried vegetables were fresh, green, crisp and write tasty. Had a Japanese colleague with me so we ordered the potstickers too-gotta reaffirm the supremacy of the almighty gyoza. They were quite good and well received, except that they were chicken."
0,"I went here with my friend and fellow yelper Tracie p we went around lunch time we both were virgins of this place but read such good reviews on yelp about it so we decided to try it.\n\nWe were looking forward to the Red velvet pancakes and all the hype about them so we shared a half order of them. Unfortunately they did not live up to all the hype, we were both expecting red velvet pancakes but got pancakes with food coloring we were pretty disappointed. The pancakes were not fluffy goodness but yet a weird texture not to tasty and the \""cream cheese syrup\""  tasted like that frosting you would put on those cinnamon rolls you get at the grocery store. \n\nNow on the flip side I ordered the Huntington omelet which had cheddar cheese, bacon and avocado which came with your choice of hash browns or seasoned potatoes i got the \""seasoned potatoes\"" which were not seasoned one bit and i also got an english muffin which was good but how can you mess that up. The omelet was pretty tasty how can you go wrong with cheese bacon and avocado , nothing that great but it was good. \n\nOverall it was an ok experience I was pretty disappointed I expected it to be way better because of all the reviews on yelp. I probably wont return here because there are better breakfast places out there."
1,"Next time you're stuck in traffic on the 51 and Glendale, look just off the freeway and you'll see desert mountains flirting with your urge to get outside and spend the day exploring NATURE ... da ba dee da ba doo. (That's right, SNL Robert Goulet reference) \n\nWhen the weather's nice, I spend as much of my time outdoors as I possibly can. I look at it like the camel filling himself with water for his desert hike, or the bear filling his belly with food for a long winter of hibernation because I know that when July and August hits...I'll be merely dreaming about the outdoors. So, Piestewa Peak (formerly known as Squaw Peak) is one of my favorite outdoor destinations. \n\nOk, so there are a couple routes you can take at Piestewa Peak and that's what I love about this area. If you're in the cardio mood, you can climb the peak and get the stair master workout. When you get to the rocky top, it's pretty awesome staring out and seeing the city on one side and a desert preserve on the other. \n\nIf you're in the mood for a flatter hike through the desert oasis itself, then park in the way back and take the path you see on the north side. Between the saguaros and the rolling peaks and valleys, it's a gorgeous hike. You could easily keep walking until the sun sets so keep an eye on the clock and remember the direction you took. As long as you do that, you're golden. There are several different paths you can take including some with lookouts, some that go deep into the valley and some that explore the ups and downs of the preserve. So be sure to do your research and figure out which path you want to take. \n\nHiker be warned!! You know how they also warn you to never leave the beaten path? Well... I didn't listen...and when I didn't listen, a jumping cactus decided to show me how it earned the name \""jumping cactus\"" by jumping right onto my ankle. With nothing but water and a lone backpack, we had to improvise ways to get the needles out of my ankle. Now here's a little tid bit of knowledge about the jumping cactus...when it attaches to let's say, you're leg, it hooks in and makes it pretty darn hard to get out. Ten painful prick removals later, I was back on board and a little sore, but kept on truckin'. So be warned and keep a solid eye out for any little cacti lying around, because they are everywhere on Piestewa Peak. But don't let that scare you! It's well worth any scrapes you get along the way!"
1,"Tried a few specialty doughnuts and also some of their classic..cake doughnuts didn't disappoint...especially the chocolate coco pebbles :)\n\nThe girl working the counter was helpful and sold us a few of her favorites. \n\nI'm not sure I'd venture here during the morning weekend hours due to the high volume of customers, but I'd definitely catch their weekday morning batches since my boyfriend and I ended up getting there by the afternoon.\n\nWe'll be revisiting soon!"
0,"We come to Phoenix once or twice a year and I've always wanted to try this place.  Needless to say it will be one & done for us.  We purchased, two adult burgers (w/fries), 3 kids meals, onion rings, stuffed mushrooms, & 3 large sodas.  Total was $45.  My wife's comment: \""freakin' rippidy rip off\""... The inside of Long Wongs was very dirty, it looked like it was on a once a week cleaning and it was day 6!  It had that slight greasy grime on the tables, chairs, arcade games.  As for the good, you pay for  drink refills which is rediculous nowadays let alone for a \""wings\"" joint.  Both the adult burgers were very weak, hardly any specialty toppings to give it a specialty flavor and way too much bun for the small preformed frozen patties.   Flavor was nonexistent.  The stuffed mushrooms tasted like they were dropped straight from the freezer into he fat fryer - worst I've ever had.  The onion rings were the best part and the only reason this place got one star. As excited as we were to try this place we were severely disappointed."

Because when we returned the tuxes we rented, the woman that was checking all the stuff gave my husband an attitude just because we didnt put the stuff nicely back in the bag. I dont think we have to put it back nicely cause we pay $200 anyway. I will never recommend this place to anyone.."
0,"First time at this location last night .  We went late in the evening and had a party of 3.  Got some drinks at the bar which was fine and then sat and waited for our table .  It was quite humid and hot where we were waiting as the air vent was dripping cause the humidity .  While we waited , not one person came to check on us or tell us why it was taking so long to be seated .  We finally were sat a table in the back after 25 min or so waiting .  Took approx 10 min before we had anyone come take our order .  We all ordered fairly simple food and only 1 time did anyone come to us to offer drinks .  We sat for nearly 45-50 min waiting patiently for our food and once we got it , no apologies or explanation.as to why it took so long .   We all had pretty much lost or apatite and barely even 10 min after getting our food , had our server come to us and ask us if we wanted desert (seriously lady ??!?) As we were waiting for our check the manager ( older lady with a raspy quick tone) was across from us , apologizing to another couple that was waiting nearly as long as us , for the wait .  No one came and asked how we were or how our service was or apologized for the delay .  Needless to say we paid and left dissatisfied and upset .  I have eaten at the old town location countless times and have always had superb service and food .  We will most likely not be returning to this location ."

1,This I one of the best and most beautiful hotels and casinos here in Vegas. The architecture and the style is amazing. The Bellagio better look out! The Aria's fountains do rival the water shows at the Bellagio! Absolutely stunning and a well thought out layout make the Aria a true gem!
0,"Besos review\n\nBeso's is a very nice place though a tad bit noisy when full. We like many reviewers here used an $79 Travelzoo voucher for a dinner supposedly worth $200. if you have one of these be prepared to be treated like a 2nd class customer. They seem to look down on you just because you are trying to get a deal on a dinner actually worth about price of voucher. Standard drinks from the bar are $14 each so keep that in mind before ordering.\n\nBecause of voucher, you can only chose select items on the menu. The crab cake appetizer was not bad. The sides mac and cheese and green beans we average at best. The main entre, 8oz steak filet was cooked perfectly and tasty. The champaign was not very good. I would say this steak dinner was not even close to worth $200 and barely worth the price of the $79 Travelzoo voucher. I have had better steaks and sides at The Outback for 1/4 the price. Also it was dinner for 2, but they automatically added $30 gratuity based on value of dinner, $198, so that was odd because service was not that good and food not worth the price.\n\nI will complain to Travelzoo.\n\nPro's:\n- nice place\n- decent service\n- good steak\n\nCon's:\n- $30 gratuity automatically added\n- average food at best\n- rude staff\n- Eve club passes were supposed to be included but Eve went bankrupt 3 days ago.\n- pricy average bar drinks"

1,"The Buffet at Wynn continues to impress!  (How have I not reviewed this place yet?!)  Spread the news - THIS is the buffet to experience if you're only going to one in Vegas!  \n\nThat's why there's always a line, right?  A quick 25 minute wait for a recent weekend brunch around noon, $31.95 later, and we are in!  \n\nGreat selection of a wide variety of foods.  Some of my personal favorites from this last trip:\n\n- Congee with Taiwanese donut fritters (first time I've seen that at a buffet outside of an Asian one!) \n- Steamed BBQ pork buns\n- Butternut squash risotto with cherries\n- Peppercorn crusted bacon\n- Prime rib (always a great buffet staple)\n- Missed out on the crab legs that they only bring out after 3:30p...\n\nAnd you can't forget the one whole ROOM dedicated to more than 20 dessert options!!  Make sure you save room to try one of everything!  I only had enough room in the belly for 6 options  =(  Love that they have gelato too - one of each flavor please!  PS - do NOT get the red velvet cupcake, it's horrible!  (the only bad thing I'll say about this place)\n\nWhat impressed me most is, despite the hype, it continues to be impressive year after year.  Hopefully it stays that way until my next trip!"
0,"This is usually one of my favorite sushi places in town and it kills me to give it one star but I must.\nI brought a group of 11 ladies here since its big enough to accommodate a group that size. I dont know if our water was having a bad day but he was not on his game thats for sure. We had ladies that waited 30 minutes for water. The wasabi and soy sauce/trays were brought out after the sushi...which took forever.\nI asked to speak to the manager who was not at all helpful and then I asked to speak to someone else since she was a space case and I didnt get the results I wanted. So some other guy came out and I explained how we didnt get menus, waters, etc. We were all getting all you can eat and drinking drinks so we were spending some money and the service was unacceptable.\nHe didnt do anything to help the situation either. They needed two servers on our table and it didnt happen.\nI am sad to say that it will be a long while until I come back which sucks since I love the screaming orgasms so much there.."
1,I went to this salon for the first time earlier this week and am so happy I did. Koryn cut my hair and she is awesome. She was so friendly and funny. I love my hair cut!! The salon is cute and really like that the chairs are sectioned off instead of on top of one another. I will absolutely be back to see Koryn.
1,Awesome awesome place!! \n\nWe sat at the bar and had a great time. At times the bar tender got busy but he was more than attentive to us. \n\nOrder the verbena. It's a really cool drink. It's not on the menu but this is the only place that makes it. \n\nIf you are in Vegas this is a bar you must visit.

0,"I was really looking forward to this due to all the great reviews and also because, after days of paying for $25 dollar entrees, my wallet needed a break big time.  \n\nMaybe they were having a bad day (I notice another 1 star reviewer went the same day I did).  Quite simply, the food was inedible.  First off, this is a place that LOVES their organ meats.  No fish or chicken tacos here so keep in mind that choices are very limited if you don't like tripe, brain, tongue or head tacos.  That's ok, we went for the carne asada fries, Abodabo and spicy pork tacos.  Fries looked awesome.  First bite....my mouth filled with fat/gristle/tendon.  Ick.  I'm a good sport, tried another bite.  Huge piece of fat.  One more bite.  Same thing.  Moved on to the abodabo taco.  First bite.   Fat.  I wasn't dumb enough to try another bite.  Spicy pork taco next.  No fat but no flavor either.  \n\nSo yeah it was only $20 for me and my husband to \""eat\"" but neither one of us actually got to swallow any of it.  Have not had this horrible of a restaurant experience in years.  I'm left wondering, did I truly go on an off day or do regular folk just love fat filled tacos?  I'm certainly not putting out another $20 to get an answer to that one."

0,"This is some of the worst Chinese food I've ever had. My wife and I ordered the pork fried rice, and chicken lo mein only to be greeted with the greasiest, scummiest Chinese food I've ever had. The pork in the fried rice was spongy and fatty. The lo mein was weighed down with way too much oil. The price is fair but better suited for edible foods.\n\nOnce again, this is probably the worst Chinese food I've had, and if Chinese food is SO BAD it stands out as being worse than the worst, there is a real problem."
0,I went to get lunch around 10:26 and there's always some kind of hassle with these people. The rude woman in drive thru said we're not serving lunch right now.

0,"I hate to give a 1 star but I had to. I'm Filipino and was really looking forward to trying this place out and was even rooting for their success but all they left me with is a bad 1st impression and an empty belly. I got there at 5:00 and they closed that day at 7:00, I tried ordering 3 different things and they were out of everything. Then the lady tried pawning off their BBQ for chicken adobo like as if I didn't know the difference. I guess they wanted me to pick from the 3 selections they had under the hot lamp that looked as if it had been there since noon. Ended up driving 30 min to Glendale and went to \""halo-halo\"" which was pretty good! I will not be returning to manilla sunrise and will make the extra trip farther to halo halo.

Plus you have Shane the Wonder DJ playing Thursday and Friday nights-he is THE MAN and has amazing music and knows how to make it all work. Shane is GOLD to me. Real people drink here, even though I would never come in on a First Friday because I don't do the hipster thing. Yeah, the bathrooms are grungy and it's not antiseptic. Go to Scottsdale if you need a McBar and for everything to be perfect and pretty. The Bikini ROCKS if you are a real, non-plastic person."

1,"3.5 stars, rounded up.\n\nMy family and I decided to escape from the touristy buffet scenes on the strip and wanted to find where the locals go to get their grub. It was around brunch time and found the Omelet House on my Yelp app, sounds good!\n\nThe ambiance had the homey feeling, with the picture frames and figurines on the wall. The chairs were sort of janky, but I didn't care. For the food, they have a large selection of entrees, especially for the omelettes. My parents ordered off the omelette menu and my brother had the $5.99 breakfast special. They also have other breakfast options if you're not an omelette fan like me. I ordered the huevos rancheros.\n\nThe food came out and wow, the omelettes my parents ordered were GINORMOUS! How many eggs do they use to make a serving? Looked like half a dozen. It also came along with potatoes that are sliced into coin shapes, such an interesting take on homefries. However, my brother $5.99 breakfast special looked so small, which my parents donated some of their omelette for him. My huevos rancheros was perfectly portioned and loved it. the tortilla chips were a great addition to scoop up the refried beans, salsa and runny egg yolk on the plate. My parents couldn't finish their omelettes even though they gave a portion to my brother. \n\nOverall, great hole-in-a-wall joint. Definitely recommend those who are bulking up on protein or just simply love eggs."
0,I really don't know what to say about Mimi's caf\u00e9 other than Bad bad bad it took me over eight minutes to put in a drink water and then I asked for a simple thing ice tea you would think this would be easy unfortunately they serve me sweet tea Needless to say I sent it back 10 minutes later my tea arrive knowing that I ordered iced tea you would think that the waitress would not serve me hot tea but I was served Hot tea this may be a great restaurant for someone in Sun City this looking for a hot cup of tea and a egg white omelette because that seemed to be exactly who was there and may God love them but I don't like hot tea that is why I ask for iced tea anyway I just wanted to paying my check and Run
1,"Nice place to run and bike with incredible views of the city. I prefer the wooded trail portion because I'm not running on pavement, it's easier on my knees (I'm old). Lots of places to park along the trail, like Washington's Landing and near Heinz Lofts. The scenery makes this one of my favorite running spots, but there are definitely more people on bikes than on foot. As long as you can dodge them and trust that they'll dodge you, it makes for a really wonderful workout. Where else can you run along side a submarine?"
0,"I wish this was a half star...\nI had a gift card for a detail so I HAD to go here.  Told the guy, no shiny stuff on the dash and don't forget to tell them about the third row...well that didn't happen.  I left my car there for 5 hours only to have to wait an additional 45 minutes to have the car finished - I found all that they forgot.  \n\nCome on people!  I am paying money to have a car detailed!  Do your job!  Don't make me wait when I am there to pick up my car after having it for that long!  \n\nThe kicker was that they \""gave\"" me a free wash for my time...no thank you!  WILL NOT GO BACK!"
1,"I actually enjoyed this place under new management. Went on a Sunday night when it was slow. Poked my head around, the new renovations and rooftop deck with a view are great. The food (I got duck, my friend got crab cakes) was pretty good. I thought everything was fairly seasoned and cooked correctly. We also got a free sangria on the house, that was good too. The waitress was nice. Downside would be parking, that lot was tiny."
1,"This place is a dream come true for me! Every year I look forward to it. Tons of shopping, cosplaying and art! If you like comics, cosplay, art or all of the above, this is just for you."
0,"Ok so me and my son went, and some long haired \nIndian fool gave me a bunch of attitude about using \nThe bathroom, We had just finished some yard work and \nWanted to wash up before we ordered but the kid made a \nBig deal out of ordering first. Never again."
1,"I've been here two times. The first time was really good, but the second was very boring flavored. I had some lemon chicken that was mediocre.  \n\nFor the price,  the last time turned me off, but will probably go back again."
0,"While pho  is within price range of other places, I can not say the same for their appetizer and rice dish.  Their rice dish is at $14 plate.  I think this place is trying to come off as an expensive Vietnamese restaurant but the location and ugly sign says otherwise."
0,Our cheap rental is turning out to be $450 more because of the dent on the hood they insist was our responsibility. \n\nBIG TIP: Make a representative walk around the car with you and sign off on the no dents before you take the car off the lot or you could be the next one duped. \n\nI have never given a company a bad rating and I should have looked  here before renting at Fox since not many people had anything good to say.
0,"This used to be my go to Chipotle, compared to the one at Alma cause their rice was always undercooked. But I might head back there now cause like stated before on other reviews, the portions SUCK! The amount of food they give: whether it's rice, meat, salsa, etc., its all VERY LITTLE. not to mention the workers there are never happy. Never. Again."
0,Friday night. Completely empty.  I learned a lesson: check before i pay cover. I had a a group and we barely walked 5 feet in and turned around to politely asked for a return. They were completely dismissive. Bad business practice.They lost business from us.
0,"This is the second time I ate at Smashburger and I must admit that the burgers at this location are not made as good as the first place that I tried on Las Vegas Blvd and Warm Springs.  I had a buy one and get one coupon, so I order both the Sin City burger and the Avocado Club burger.  The burger was very greasy, overcooked and not as tasty as the burgers at the other location.  It also was put together very sloppily and very hard to eat without everything falling out of the burger.  I was quite disappointed.  Needless to say I won't be coming back to this location."
0,This place gets 2 stars cause the food is decent.  The biggest problem I have with this place is they can never get my order right. I always check my order before I leave but the burritos they always screw up. Can't really tell what's in it until you take a bite and I'm not about to unroll a burrito before the leave the restaurant.  Maybe I'll be going back to Robertos
0,"I'm a Las Vegas food and wine writer by trade, so I learned a long time ago to take the good with the bad and focus on writing about the positives of a dining experience while ignoring the variables that can sometimes detract from an otherwise solid establishment. However, I feel that my most recent unpleasant experience at China Poblano requires me to issue a warning to future diners, and that is to STAY AWAY. Seriously, avoid this place and save your money. I used to absolutely love this place, the food was fabulous and unique, the drinks were delicious and creative, and the ambiance was festive and hip. The service has always been aloof and full of bad attitude (Save for a delightful bartender named Steve who was there when they opened but has since moved on to more hospitable pastures.), but I chalk that up to the general attitude of the Cosmopolitan - which generally has the worst service on the strip across the board. Since they opened, I've chosen to overlook that and make this my go to for entertaining clients and out of town guests in a casual setting as it really did have top notch food and a cozy atmosphere. Alas, that is no more. It's been a couple of months since I dined with them, and apparently there has been an overhaul on the menu. The dishes are still tasty, however they have downsized many of them to tapas-like portions while keeping the prices the same (they were once reasonable, now they're typical strip mark-up). This was irritating, but not shun-worthy. That was reserved for the service that has gone from disinterested to disdainful. Our server, Richard, I admit had a sweet personality and an adorable smile - that is for the two minutes when he greeted us and took our order. Once he did that we literally never saw him again until he brought us our check. This was not his fault, he was clearly the only bartender on duty. Why they had him waiting tables as well while the bar was busy was beyond me. My companion and I each ordered salads. Her, the beet and avocado (which was my favorite until now - it's been pared down to a tiny fraction of what it once was.) and I the tuna ceviche (which could have been excellent had it not been drowning in an over abundance of lemon and soy). The pathetic excuse for a beet salad came out a full 10 minutes before my ceviche did. I waited for our server to notice, even attempting to flag him down, but he never bothered to come over. I finally stopped the tall, bald corpse of a manager (you'll know exactly who I mean if you see him) to ask if perhaps I might get my lunch before my companion finished. His response was a dippy 'Well, ya know we have two kitchens so stuff doesn't always come out together, your server should have told you that'. That is the single worst excuse I've ever heard, and frankly, as I learned as a server many years ago it is unacceptable to EVER take out only part of a table's order. Not only was the service terrible but the manager was so annoyed that his diners would dare to ask to receive their food at the same time that he couldn't contain his disdain. I feel just awful that I inconvenienced him so by intruding upon his establishment to order food. I felt that unwelcome. No matter - I will never take another guest there again and I hope to save many a dear Yelp reader from wasting their hard earned dollar on such nasty service and portions of food fit to starve a hamster. I will happily (and very vocally) never ever darken China Poblano's door ever again."
1,"A friend and I went here for dinner on a Monday night based on the reviews, and I'm happy to report that we were both very happy.\n\nThe ambiance is pleasant and what one would expect from such a restaurant, although the location in the strip mall is not ideal.  The place is small, with a bit of outdoor seating.  We found when the restaurant filled up, it was a bit noisy--being seated by the kitchen did not help this--but we were still able to converse without much distraction. \n\nThe high point here is the food.  I've found authentic italian to be a rarity in the valley, and I very much enjoyed our meal.  I found the menu very pasta-heavy, but the selection was excellent.  If you like italian food even the slightest bit, I imagine you'll find something on their menu that you'll enjoy.  As for me, I had the lasagna, and it was excellent, and I would certainly order it again.  The gnocchi my friend had were delicious--clearly hand made.  When I return, I'll have high expectations for the food. \n\nService was attentive without being overbearing.  I found interacting with one of the owners quite pleasant--it's always a bonus to see an owner on the floor caring about your experience. Reservations are probably a good idea any night people might be out.  I was surprised to find the place fairly busy on a Monday.\n\nWell, I highly recommend Tesoro--I don't think I've had a better Italian meal in Phoenix."
1,I ordered 2 floral arrangements for a funeral and specified the price range and a few of the flowers and colors I wanted and my preference for something simple but elegant.  They did a fabulous job and both arrangements stood out from the rest.  The cost was reasonable compared to other florists and I would definitely recommend them.  This was the first time I used this location but have been pleased with all the arrangements from other AJ's locations.
1,I don't know about the best pizza I've ever eaten part. For fast good for your kids type of pizza that you have to bake yourself. I would have to say its pretty decent. They run a clean operation in the two different locations that I have been in.
1,"So far I am very pleased with this dealership.\nHave had service done on my 2006 Prius many times and I was always treated fair.\nI liked the 2006 so much that I just purchased a 2012 Prius the other day.\nThe salesman John Dunkleberger is a top notch guy, go see him if you want to buy a car! He was never pushy and even a few days after the sale was willing to help me with some technical questions I had. Thanks Riverview, I give you my personal approval and recommendation!"
1,"I've stayed at this hotel several times and it is my favorite off-strip hotel. \n\nThe Solitaire suite can fit 6 people comfortably. Everything is spacious, bathroom has a whirpool bathtub, and it has a balcony. The pool is both indoor and outdoor, and provides decent eye candy (at least when I was there).\n\nThe staff is also very friendly and accomodating. Upon request (and as long as they have available drivers), they will drive you down to the strip so you don't have to cab it!"
1,"Absolutely luv this place! Tina is my go-to manicurist & she's amazing! Never have I bleed from her doing my nails, always friendly & we talk the entire time! Lol I'm glad I found this place!!"
0,"Good doctor but horrible care. \n\nDr. Swainston's office is horribly managed. From three hours waits for appointments,  to \""forgetting\"" to send prescriptions to the pharmacy to \""forgetting\"" to follow up on positive lab test results, and \""forgetting\"" that you are there for an appointment, they are the worst run medical practice I have ever seen. \n\nI understand that some of the problem may stem from the fact that Dr. Swainston is a good surgeon and he has a busy practice. But lots of doctors have busy practices yet they have adequate competent staffing. You can never get access to him and it's almost impossible to even get the attention of a nurse. You have to double check everything that is being done as they promise to do things and then do it wrong or never do it at all. You have to constantly be on hold only for them to take a message and then not bother calling you back. \n\nFor a prescription that was supposed to have several refills authorized, I had to call nurse to get it, called twice without a call back, and finally gave up trying to get the nurse. I got an appointment to see the doctor to try to get it filled, get told that they had sent it in and that pharmacy had made a mistake, told me they would resend it to make sure, never sent it, had to wait for 4 days over a long weekend to get a nurse to call me back to try to get it authorized. Why does it take over a half dozen phone calls and an additional doctor visit to follow up just to get one prescription that was supposed to have refills already to get written properly? Why does it have to take 6 hours out of my life to get one prescription properly filled?\n\nThis is just one example. \n\nI had a surgery with Dr. Swainston several months ago. I had a lot of complications. And I believe that all of them were due to the fact there was not proper care before and after the surgery. So does it matter how good a surgeon is if the pre-care and post-care is crappy? I suffered needlessly for months due to their bad care. \n\nIf you have any other choice, avoid this doctor. He's good but his team is clearly overwhelmed and/or does not care enough to improve the care it gives it's patients. It's just not worth it. It's really a nightmare dealing with them. I am so glad I no longer need to deal with their practice again."
0,"I'm sad to have to write a negative review, we had high hopes for this place based on the other reviews.\nWe are new to this side of town, and tonight we were at our new house painting - none of our dishes are here yet so we figured why not get Chinese? So we ordered from Bobo - Mongolian beef with fried rice, 2 egg rolls and a wonton soup. \nIt came in about 40 minutes (a little slow, but the delivery guy was nice). When I opened the package up I was disappointed to find no spoon - I have no dishes so I can't eat my wonton soup. However, after looking at it, I didnt want to eat it anyway...it was super oily and had some kind of gross bright purple mystery meat in it (pork? Chicken? Something more sinister? Honestly I couldn't tell). My boyfriends Mongolian beef was okay, although not at all spicy like I had ordered. Fried rice was greasy and bland at best. \nSorry Bobo, you won't be our new Chinese takeout place :-("
1,"I wasn't supposed to be in Charlotte, but canceled flights, etc.  You know how that goes, so I spent several hours here.\n\nThings I like about this airport:\n\nInteresting food options, and what I had was good.  I never expected to be eating tasty BBQ Brisket, Beans, Cornbread & Fried Pickles at an airport restaurant.  \n\nRockers.  All over the place there are rocking chairs.\n\nClean, open feel to the architecture.\n\nSmoothly operating airport.\n\nWireless.\n\nBasically, if you have to be stuck at an airport, I'd take this one over many others!"
0,"Took 10 minutes to have server first come to the table. 20 minutes to get the bill processed. No apology for the wait. Good drinks, poor service."
1,What a very nice place. All the staff we dealt with were so very friendly. The hotel and room were nice and clean. I would defiantly stay here again
0,"Out of business. For some reason, I have to write a whole paragraph about this. So, I will say that they are really, really, really, really, really out of business. Doors locked. Signs gone. Paint peeling off."
1,"Good Beer and Good Pirogies, what else could a connoisseur want? Having this all in an old church makes it that much better. Whenever I'm in da Burgh I make it a point to stop here. \n\nJust go there, you won't be disappointed."
1,"Met a few friends for dinner last night- we were seated right away, but it was very early.  As we were eating, the place filled up very quickly so keep that in mind.  \nThe menu was varied with both pub foods, salads and entrees- I really enjoyed the Amy's salad and I'm not really a fan of spinach but it was delish.  The veggie sandwich was likewise satisfying and the service was just fine.  Overall, we were impressed and will plan to return often."
1,"While this may not be as scenic as Old Port or have as many attractions, this is a great place for a walk, jog, or bike ride.  There is a bike path that goes around the entire canal, and the it's not on the road either. It's actually a path and trail away from the cars and near the water, so you can bike at a leisurely pace.  In addition, along most of the canal is green space, so if you are tired, you can sit on the grass or bench and have a nice little picnic along the water.\n\nAll in all, maybe not an attraction for everyone, but it's a great escape from the hustle and bustle of the city."
1,"Fantastic place, nice people, awesome food, great atmosphere. It's a newer-age tapas bar with a James Bond and 1960s Turkish chic theme. \n\nThe menu inclues tapas that range from curry chicken to steak tartare as well as a gourmet poutine."
1,My hubby and I were first timers to this place and it won't be the last time. The complementary chips and salsa and been dip is very yummy. We irdered chicken fajitas and they quick to the table and very good. Our waters were never empty the service was great. We had a server named John and he was so dedicated  about his work and you could tell. Super friendly and attentitive!
0,"I wish I could give these guys negative stars. They are the WORST health insurance company I have ever had.  Same as the previous reviewer noted, they never give a straight answer, they talk around in circles to confuse you, give you different answers every time you call and never let you speak to a supervisor.  \n\nYou will NEVER know how much it will cost you out of pocket to see a doctor with these guys.  Unfortunately, I'm stuck with them because they're the only plan my employer offers, but have more than once seriously considered firing them and just buying my own plan elsewhere."
1,"Been here more than once after a night out of drinking.. But now I can say I've been here sober and not so sober!\n\nQuick seating, although it gets busy! Friendly staff & good for kids when the sun is still up. \n\nLike everyone says-- it IS like a Cheesecake Factory minus the cheesecake, but in my opinion and if I'm willing to make the drive out here, I like it better! \n\nThis time around the better half and I had :\nBlue Cheese Salad - not a blue cheese fan but this was good, could have a little less dressing\nCalamari - FAVORITE! I liked the added fried zucchini and onions! \nKobe Meatballs - big meatballs, juicy and tender meatballs! Not too much sauce, comes on a bed of creamy polenta.\n\nI unfortunately could not have any of the pasta dish but it did look good! \n\nMust try if you're in the strip area!"
0,"HUGE fan of the Scottsdale location, came to check this one out since the wait on Sundays in Old Town is pretty long. (Obvi. The food is great.) I'm writing this review on my phone while we continue to wait for the check. Our waitress went missing a while ago... Not that she was around much to begin with. This was after the hostess forgot about us, even though we were in plain sight the whole time. Food is still good, same offerings as the Scottsdale location. I'd suffer the wait at Old Town for better service. Well... That's my review! Still no sign of the waitress or check....."
0,"I go to this store occasionally to buy some spices which I cannot get in other places. The price here is one of the highest in Las Vegas with low-average quality goods. Be careful to read the bill before you leave, I have been charged of goods I never bought. Personally I wont suggest this store If you are looking for quality items at cheap or moderate price because they don't offer either."
0,"I was appalled by the lack of flexibility on the part of the management with regard to dietary restrictions. One of our party of 9 adults asked for a salad since they are a strict vegan and the management would not serve any vegetables in the form of a salad at lunchtime on the weekend, even though they clearly had vegetables on the premises. Furthermore, when asked if we could eat our own avocado, we were told that there would be a charge for giving a plate!!!! I do believe the server felt terrible that one guest could not be accommodated at all. With the number of people with allergies and health concerns, I am flabbergasted that a new restaurant such as this could have such a rigid and disrespectful attitude towards a patron.\n\nNeedless to say, we won't be back."
1,"Decent McDonalds. Definitely better than the one in Houston that I used to go to and wrote a complaint on them for being consistently negligent. I like this one and its a keeper! \n\nPlace - two stories and for the most part, clean.\n\nPrice - it's Mickey D's. \n\nService - somewhat quick in the drive-thru, friendly people. They only forgot once, but it's forgivable."
1,"What a quaint little bistro this is! \n\nWe made reservations to dine with some friends for dinner.  There was a nice ambiance in the dining area with a guitarist and singer that played light music during our visit. The restaurant was very welcoming and cozy.\n\nWe started off with the Dungeness Crab Cake.  They were good!  Not over the top but still good.   This was served with mixed greens,  At the same time a bread basket was brought out for the table.  It was just ok.  It was kind of mushed and dry.  For my entree I chose the Pan seared white fish in which the waiter was raving about.   I  can see why...  Delicious and tasty!  The garlic white wine sauce smothered the fish.  The pesto mashed potatoes that accompanied were ok.  I wish there was more of a pesto flavor.  \n\nThe service here is impeccable.  Our waiter was very attentive.  The other staff which helped with refills were very polite and accommodating.   \n\nOur entire group enjoyed the food and service. I would recommend trying them out! Thanks Bernards!"
0,"Dismal, abject, revolting.  These are words one would use to describe the contents of a garbage can, or a snuff film. You know nice, pleasant things that one would enjoy on a Sunday afternoon. Shogun however deserves none of this high praise. These words are a lofty goal by their standards. \n\nI was so unfortunate to collide unwillingly with this place one Saturday for lunch and decided to order the unagi roll and the Panko Udon. I was expecting some common sense from the chef/wank they picked up off the street, but even hope fails occasionally in an explosion of misery. The unagi roll was horrible. The rice was not fully cooked, the contents were soggy and tasted old. The sushi would have been better if the chef had taken the ingredients, put them down his pants, sat on them for 5 minutes while riding a bull, and then vomited on the resulting creation. Later the Panko Udon arrived, and it was even worse. I understand that it was panko breaded and not a tempura batter, but still it was absolutely horrendous. They could not have overcooked the vegetables, shrimp, and fish more.  It was greasy, bland, insipid cooking that could not have been made better even if it were served with a diamond ring.  The store bought, cheap as you can find udon was undercooked and had the texture of noodles that had been sitting for about 30 minutes in a colander. These little beauties were served in a pool of horrific bottled tsuyu sauce that left a lingering chemical aftertaste that was just a delight to behold.\n\nI would not eat here again even if my scrotum were stapled to a chair and I was chained to a table. I have to give this place one star too many because Yelp unfortunately has a one star minimum. I would even rate any fast food chain better than this place. I have had better airline food.\n\nCheers,\nUntil then, get the beers in...\nJust not at Shogun."
1,"AZ VIP and more importantly Dave have always provided the highest level of service in the transportation industry not only in Scottsdale, but anywhere I have traveled.  In the eight + years I have been using them Dave has gone out of his way on multiple occasions to accommodate me and my needs.  AZ VIP is the first call I make when I need a car in the Phoenix area."
1,"I adore this place!  I've had several different pizzas, the calzone, stuffed pizza, and a few entrees... Oh and of course dessert!  I enjoy their pizza and calzone the most.  The garlic knots are great, I remember liking the rice balls.  The owner (I guess he's the owner) is very friendly and personable!  For desserts my daughter and I love the brownie overload, which is creamy peanut butter sandwiched with two brownies and dipped in chocolate! The macaroons are excellent, but the chocolate covered cheesecake wasn't my favorite.  I will go back for the pizza and desserts!"
0,"The food was alright, not the best sandwich I've had but it tasted good. I don't understand why they only serves one size sandwiches. Most of the staff was decent and well mannered. However I will never return here as long as that bald guy works here. He was completely unprofessional to my girlfriend and rude to both of us. If that is their idea of customer service, I do not want to experience it ever again. Best thing about the area it is in is there are plenty of other places to eat."
1,"The restaurant is hidden away in the corner of a busy strip mall near Chompie's.  Happy hour is Sun-Thu 5pm-6pm, when all sushi (non-market priced nigiris not makis) on the menu are 50% off.  Most items are $4-$5.  The highest price item is amaebi (raw sweet shrimp) $7, which was huge and very fresh.  The head is served deepfried which is better than any french fry.  I also like the oysters with ponzu sauce."
1,"Believe it or not, I went on a first date here, and I had a pretty good time! The experience of roaming through this place was interesting. On the first floor, there are relics containing different phallic and fertility statues. The second floor has media rooms showing film snippets and pictures of a very graphic content. It is a museum on sexuality, and It's not for the faint of heart; If you're queasy or have a prudish contempt for pornography and naked images, then this is not a good venue as they have tons of sexually graphic media upstairs. \n\nI personally thought that they did a decent job of staying close to the museum aspect of it. I certainly didn't feel filthy after seeing those images, but they did pique at my curiosity - which is what museums are supposed to do (among other things). It was also fun looking through the museum shop - I learned from my date what a \""fluffer\"" means; it was inscribed on one of the T-shirts that they were selling :)"
0,Its airport food. Had the Cesar salad with chicken. My husband ordered a pizza with pepperoni.  My salad came 10 min before his pizza. I thought that was odd. By the time I finished his meal had finally arrived. My salad was very over dressed so make sure you ask for dressing on the side. His pizza was okay.  Would not come back.
1,"I can't recommend this shop highly enough. On a Thanksgiving road trip my friend made a stop in Phoenix and his water pump went out when he got here. I checked Yelp to find him a mechanic and had him call Honest-1. After he talked to the owner, Tom, he said he felt confident that he'd be able to fix it so there was no need to call another shop. \n\nWe dropped the vehicle off at Honest-1 at 1:30 (on the day before Thanksgiving!), and Tom assured us that the work would be done that day which was critical since my friend was leaving Phoenix on Friday morning. We came back at 4:30 and the car was fixed and waiting for us. A lot of auto shops would have added a charge to the bill for doing the work within such a short window of time but that wasn't the case with Honest-1. On top of that we were given a discount for telling him we found him on Yelp. They also participate in a program with other shops that guarantees the work no matter where you are in the country. \n\nThe lobby is spotlessly clean, has a comfortable waiting area, TV, coffee, and a computer for customer use. Definitely five stars all the way around."
0,"This was the worst buffet experience of my life!! My family of 6 and I went out to eat at 7:00 on a Wednesday and the place stunk even before we walked in, but we bravely walked in. Then were hit by a pungent fish odor and were a little wary but still wanted to eat!!! So we got our plates and then aimlessly began walking around looking at ALL of the dried out meats and sparsely filled trays. Everything we tried tasted like it has been sitting there for hours. We tried to fill our plates but everything we tried was horrible. All 4 of my kids hated all of their food and they are NOT picky eaters! It was there request to go to Chinese. After everyone was tired of being disappointed by the food choices and sending back full plates of food. We tried to get some ice cream.. OH MY GOSH --- I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO GROSSED OUT!!! The \""Scoop\"" for the ice cream had mold on it and was attached to the wall sitting in a bowl of brown ice cream water. SO DISGUSTING!!! I asked to waitress to please bring us a new \""scoop\"" and she brought us a spoon to get our ice cream out of the 20 gallon buckets.. A soup spoon people.... So when I walked up with my almost $80.00 bill and told them how unhappy I was with there food, service, and cleanliness of their establishment. The offered me 10 percent off lol or they would call 911--- I let them call 911 because someone was going to have to force me to pay for something I would not give to my neighbors dog....... WHICH THEY DID!! They called the police on my family (remember we have 4 children) because we did not want to pay for the worst eating experience I have ever had. DO NOT EAT HERE!!"

I loved the huge selection of arts, crafts, jewelry, and entertainment at this festival.  Since well behaved dogs are allowed, of course our doggie Bailey tagged along.  We are looking forward to the next Tempe Arts Fest!"
0,"It was later and we were in Vegas for my niece's 21st birthday.  We were staying at Vdara so decided to give Haze a try since it was in the neighboring hotel Aria.  The staff is super friendly and managed to get us a table in no time.  We didn't have to wait in the long line or make a reservation. However, that being said, this place so-so compared to the more upscale nightclubs in Vegas. Bottle service is about $500 a bottle and the decor reminds me of clubs I could find in Hollywood.  For a true Vegas nightclub experience, got to any of the other clubs. Ex, Tao, Tryst, XS..."
1,"Glad I don't have to go all the way to NY for a frozen hot chocolate. Yes the name sounds ironic but it is what it sounds like. Hot chocolate but frozen. \n\nI noticed they had other flavors which I'll have to try when I go back. The best thing about this place is, it's outside and has Togo service!\n\nDon't have to go thru the trouble of getting thru a casino to get this dessert drink.\n\nLocated at the CP's casino."
1,"Our first meal upon arrival to Las Vegas, even before we checked into our Hotel... Service here is very friendly and the food just amazing.\nWe had the Shrimp Toast with bold flavors of the sausage and you could taste the garlic on the toast.\nMy son had the Fat Choy Burger, such good burger patty, well seared with the fried egg on top, very well done burger.\nI had the short rib rice and let me tell you, that short rib had to be one of the most tender and delicious I've ever had. served also with a little salad on the side which is lightly dressed.\nLast but not least, we split the Duck Bao! Oh My! soft little pillow \""tacos\"" :) with crunchy duck skin and soft tender duck meat, fresh little \""salad\"" all in one little package...\nTo drink we had a \""Gummy Bear\"" soda and a Peach mellow yellow.\nCan you believe our bill was only around $40! incredible."
0,"The airport is clean and looks like its been recently renovated. I'm not really fond that the rental car location is 10  minutes away though. Also, i dislike how you have to do a full body scan and get your fingers swiped for bomb stuff.. its like... really? out of all the airports ive been to, this is the only one that made me do it. lastly, the US airways employee at the airport booked me the wrong flight.!!! she gave me a ticket but when she put us in teh system, it was to a different place. we ended up staying in phoenix another night since there were no more flights back to so.cal.. NOT COOL! AND, they wouldnt even cover the cost of the hotel. They only offered a discount.. suppppppper lame!"
1,"Fantastic,make reservations ahead of time books quick\nVery classy very traditional,one of my favorite dinning places in Vegas\nI recomend the Filet and the creamed corn,don't et full on the bread basket,the bacon muffins are addictive\n\n\nWell Done"
0,"I recently moved in this August expecting an upscale apartment.  In the end, cabinets, floors, and other features are very bottom of the line.  Floors are not wood, but more of a thin plastic floor covering with tons of scratches.  Appliances are stainless steel, but my dishwasher has already broken 1 month into renting.  Maintenance seems very slow to fix problems, taking at least a week to fix problems.  \nThe building also has problems with the fire alarms and they often go off in the middle of the night, multiple times a night.   The company still has not seemed to find a solution to this problem yet (which they continue to attribute to dust)!! \nThe only positive I can say about the building thus far is that the building managers are fairly friendly, remember my name, and usually keep us up to date on things happening in the building.  \nOverall, I am glad I am the first person to live here, since the furnishings won't last and will seem very run down in a few years.  Hopefully maintenance improves.  Way overpriced for what you are getting, especially if renting out efficiency or one bedroom."
0,"HORRIBLE SERVICE.  We honestly had to walk out on our order because the kitchen time was 35 minutes and up once you placed your food order.  It took our server 15 minutes to even approach us for drinks upon arrival.  She never checked back for refills while we tried to wait for our food.  None of the other customers in the restaurant were pleased with the service.  Many people including us requested to speak to a manager.  Upon speaking to him he simply apologized and made an excuse for the kitchen being backed up.  The manager did not assist the servers nor did he seem to know how to handle managing a restaurant.  The wait staff seemed very frazzled and overwhelmed for such a small restaurant.  Essentially the staff seemed untrained and unable to handle their small section of tables.  We told them we would like to cancel our order and left to go to another breakfast restaurant.  We never had a chance to try the food so I cannot comment on the quality.  However, the menu was very limited if you do not like waffles.  It also was over priced with most breakfast entrees costing $9-$11 and not having large portions from what we could observe from the few tables who were fortunate enough to have received their food after the very long wait.  Overall, we will never go back to this establishment and we would not recommend it to any friends or family in the future."
0,"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but what people should know about this place is NO MORE 25 CENT CHICKEN WINGS.\n\nThat's right.\n\nNormally, that fact alone wouldn't justify a 1-star review. But everything else was just horrible. We came here expecting our beloved, delicious 25-cent wings that we've been coming for for years, only to be told that this was discontinued 2 months ago. Now you can have 10 wings and fries for 8 dollars. Whatever, we'd come here all the way from the Venetian and we were hungry. The fact that there was no wait, like there usually is, should have tipped us off. \n\nThe restaurant was dirty and had sticky tables. I don't know why I did, but I ordered the fried calamari, which came out burned-looking and the calamari chewy, rubbery, and gross. I couldn't even have my friends try them because I didn't want to make more than one person ill. The waitress never asked why I hadn't touched my plate, or offered anything else.\n\nMy friend also had the \""worst chicken fingers she'd ever had,\"" consisting of mostly bread. There really wasn't any saving grace to this place at all.\n\nI felt bad for raving about this place and taking my friends here, and also for telling everyone else I knew about it. I loved this place and their amazing wing deals for years, and am sad that I can't come back. Dan Marino would be ashamed, too."
0,"My wife and I went to this location after being at Circus Circus at approximately 10pm a Friday night.  It was busy, but not chaotic.\n\nYou place your order at one end of the counter and pick up at the end of the counter.\n\nI ordered a Quarter pounder with cheese combo and asked to make it large.  My wife simply ordered a small drink and a McFlurry.  We specifically told the girl we were eating in.  \n\nWhen our number was called, our food was in a to go bag.  I was also only given one small cup.  When I asked where my large drink cup was, I was informed that the combo which I paid extra for did not include a drink????\n\nThe lady was wearing a white shirt and spoke very poor English.  When I showed her my receipt where it said I had paid for a large Combo, she told me I was mistaken.  I then proceeded to go back to the cashier who had rung up my order and ask her what had happened.  She informed me that I should have got a Large cup as well as small cup but the lady in the white was her Manager.  I then asked to speak to another manager.  The cashier then waited until the female manager went in the back and a male manager came up, apologized, and gave me my Large cup.  ?????  He agreed that I was correct and that the cashier had rung up our order correctly but could not give me a reason as to why the female manager would not give me a Large cup."

0,"I have been to this airport so many times the past year not because I am an party animal or a gambler. I just happen to be Southwest frequent flyer, and Southwest just happens to put me here waiting for my connecting flight so many times. \n\nThis airport is Small and OLD. It is really really old. I am more used to it now, but the first time I got there. I was scared for a second. The restrooms are old, too. I hope they renovate this airport soon. The city should spend some tax money from all the Casino on this airport!!!!\n\nThere are slot machines everywhere, but I don't see that many people actually play. I never did, so I have no feelings towards that. I'm neither bothered by it. They do have few food options like Nathan's burger or sandwiches and hot dog. There is, by the way, a good chocolate store in the middle of the airport if you want to get some gifts or just get your chocolate fix here. It's not cheap. But good chocolate is never cheap anyway. \n\nEven it's very old, but everything is pretty well organized. All the signs are clear. And the line for getting a cab is long but super fast and super organized. No need to bump into anyone to fight for taxi, just get in line, the staff will tell you exactly what to do and where to go. Thumbs up!\n\nThere's also shuttles to most of the hotels. I believe it is $7 per person. It's very convenient."
0,"I will rarely take the time to complain about service, but this place is terrible. We sat for 10 or more minutes until we were acknowledged, not by our server, but a manager. Then maybe five minutes later (I am being fair here) a server brought our drinks  we ordered from the manager and almost walked away without taking our order. Furthermore, there was no apology for our 15 minute wait just to get our drinks. Mind you it wasn't even that busy. None of the servers smiled, the margaritas were not great and were mostly mix, and the food was way over priced. I got two tiny bland fish tacos for $12. If you're looking for good service and good Mexican food, I recommend going somewhere else. Otherwise, by all means don't say you weren't warned."
1,"I really enjoyed this spot, located in historical Chandler by the famous Crowne Plaza Resort Hotel San Marcos. Eat in the bar if you can - a super cozy room with great ambiance."
1,"The food here is good, but overpriced.\n\nCLEANLINESS: 4/5\nSERVICE: 3/5\nFOOD: 4/5\n- ABC (Avocado, Brie, Caramalized Onions) Burger\n- Frozen Hot Chocolate\n\nI don't remember why this place was famous, but supposedly it's in a movie or something and the original one is in New York. The decor is really girly and circus-like. Our party decided to sit outside, but that was probably a wrong move because it was hella windy. Luckily they had some heaters on, so that made it somewhat better. \n\nOur waitress was alright. She didn't seem very personable or present. She was barely around, and there weren't even a lot of customers outside. However this other guy with curly hair was also waiting tables nearby, and eventually helped us whenever we needed something. Thank you curly hair man. The supervisor or whoever that blond lady was, seemed really angry and mean. Please take that negativity behind the doors and away from the customers. I hate hearing employees getting scolded right next to any customer in a restaurant... it makes things so awkward.\n\nNow for the food! The ABC Burger was pretty damn good. It was kinda hard to bite because it was stacked up high. It was kind of small, but enough for me. The burger came with these awesome sweet potato fries. My definite favorite. I asked for some honey mustard, which made it even more bomb. The meat was cooked correctly and was full of flavor. For dessert, I got the frozen hot chocolate which was alright. Nothing out of this world. \n\nWould I come here again? Probably, just because it's Vegas and those sweet potato fries are always a win for me. Too bad the menu is overpriced!"
0,"This place has tasteless food that is over priced. It is not very far from my house and would be easy to stop at but I choose to go to Suzie's, or Poncho's in Phoenix. If you want good Mexican food do your self a favor and go somewhere else."
1,"Like it a lot!\n\nProbably quite a grown up bar. We headed here later on - closer to 11ish on a Friday night (V-night) and it was pretty quiet. It used to be the old Standard Bar - black frontage and from the outside appeared small but the bar is actually quite tardis like inside. Mix of chairs and tables, high stools and some booth areas which I'm sure would appeal to groups or those on date night alike. \n\nThe gin is the main draw here. They have a list of the common gins they do on a blackboard and with which mixer they should be served - Fentimans or Fever Tree. I had a Caorunn and a Botanist, both of which were very easy to drink. It won't be the cheapest round of drinks - two G&T's were about \u00a310 but very enjoyable. Other gins can be seen on the shelves - Caz opted for a Boodles and they also do Blackwoods gin too which is lovely. We missed on on trying the saffron gin as it had been their launch night the previous night and they were out of that.\n\nNice surroundings - wooden floors, tables and chairs with blue/grey walls. Not overly bright inside but good enough for a late night supping gin. They also do food - didn't see any menus as they'd probably been moved from the tables. There was a bit of an older crowd in last night when we were in which was good to avoid it being too 'hipsterish' and the 80's soundtrack was fab. I'll return to further explore the gin menu and try the food!"
1,I eat here at least once a week.  The portions are very generous and the food is outstanding.  I usually get the beef and chicken combo and it is always great. Service is quick and friendly.
0,"Ugh. I feel like I just paid $7 (admission fee with coupon) to watch a bunch of infomercials. You walk in and it's just a bunch of booths selling spas and blinds and phones and non-working health devices. I saw nothing \""cultural\"" or \""religious\"". The food was way overpriced for what it was. If you have no means of getting out of the city, then this might be the place for you; I have experienced festivals waay better than this one. \n\nEven though parking is free and everyone wants a close parking spot (who doesn't?), you're better off parking in the Bass Pro Shop parking lot and walking either through the store or around the Bass Pro Shop and to the front of the Silverton. You'll save yourself a lot of time and hassle and the police directing traffic. If you take that main turn to the Silverton, you're going to be stuck for a while with everyone else going to the Festival. Keep going straight and around the corner and you'll see a place where you can turn left to the Bass Pro Shop parking area.\n\nOh, and don't forget to bring CASH. Don't get stuck pulling out money at the ATMs they set up front."
0,"Be prepared to be shaken down by the infamous tow truck driver (white truck) who is definitely in cahoots with someone in management.  Don't leave your car parked in the garage at night even to unload groceries for a few minutes.  We had a great run in while unloading groceries and even though we had a parking pass.  Guy wanted money to not tow the car just because we were unloading heavy items for 10 mins.  The dude eventually backed down, but got really heated and intense.  He's out every night (gotta make the quota) preying on so many others, what a shame.   I wonder what the buildings cut is?  \n\nHad a corporate studio apartment that was just OK, but for the price there are definitely better options close by.  The building is in OK shape and is in a great location for downtown Charlotte and is the only reason I gave this one star.  The pool brings out shady folks at night and the gym is basically worthless equipment wise.  The people in the building are a mix of young and professional folks as well as no kids.  The building alarm tends to go off for nothing every few weeks and is quite annoying since you need to evacuate and wait for the fire department to give the OK.\n\nOverall there are much better options so definitely a stay away"
1,"The Bank nightclub in the Bellagio Hotel and Casino is one of the first and most respected clubs in the Las Vegas nightlife scene, and remains a favorite for tourists, VIPs, event celebrators and industry professionals. \n\nA night at The Bank can be described as a sensory overload, filling your ears with beats from music from famous DJs that you won't be able to resist dancing to, and the decor is accented with black and gold. On Sunday nights, industry professionals fill the club to enjoy a legendary weekly dance party.\n\nHit the dance floor and see why the crowd dresses to impress and flocks to The Bank to drink, dance and party in style every weekend. They come for the music and good times, but keep coming back for the exceptional hospitality and service."
0,"This is my last update. I am not satisfied at all. After playing telephone tag for two days, with a package delivery pending the next day, I physically went to the site and spoke with Adrian Maldonado. He backed his driver completely, but told me that the immediate supervisor would be with him when he delivered my package and that the driver would personally apologize to me.\n\nThe driver, who I now know is named Clark, didn't say a word until I asked him to apologize. I was told what a good driver he was for the past 15 years and that he would not be parking in handicapped spaces anymore and I had nothing to worry about in the future because he would do a good job. I had his bosses guarantee. When in response to the supervisor asking me if I was satisfied, I said, \""No, it was my understanding that Clark would be apologizing personally,\"" the supervisor tried to tell me that because he was the boss, I could be assured that Clark wouldn't do these things anymore. I again reiterated that this is not what I was told would happen. I then turned to Clark and explained to him directly why what he did was not cool.\n\nHis non apology was \""I'm sorry you feel that way.\"" \n\nSo some effort made, but not really changing my mind about how horrible this company is run locally. Still think Clark is an asshole who thinks this is all a joke. Why should he change. It is obvious his supervisors don't want to make him change and want to defend him. \n\nHowever, we are stuck with them for the moment because we have several items pending, but once our current situation changes, future efforts will be made to avoid UPS as much as possible. \n\nSupposedly competition was supposed to be good for the market, but now two companies dominate the delivery industry. FedEx is barely better. Competition, my ass. Big Brown's logo ought to be \""Logistics over customers!\"""

1,"Went here based off the reviews for my 25th birthday and had a great time. The food was amazing - I ordered the General Tso's Chicken and it was perfect. The service was phenomenal, it's not exactly a big place, but they checked on all the tables quite often and the lady at the cash register made sure everyone was doing good on drinks/sauce/food.\n\nI went here with my family and all of the food they ordered such as the dumpling appetizer / the shrimp with vegetables / hot and sour soup and sweet and sour chicken looked amazing. Everyone was very happy with the food quality and the service provided as well as the price for the food (very reasonable). The interior was also very clean and it looked like the staff genuinely cared for the business and the customer. \n\nI will definitely be coming back here."
1,"This place is amazing.  We come to Vegas twice a year and the Public House is always on the agenda. Firstly, we were excited to learn that our waiter Arnie, who we were lucky to meet last year, was still there. Arnie is incredibly accommodating and offers kind attention to your needs as a diner. I suffer from food allergies, and I needed an alternative for bread. I asked for sliced cucumber... Where other waiters have said no. Arnie said, let me see what I can do.  Minutes later, I had sliced cucumber to have with my p\u00e2t\u00e9 and Bone marrow.  Speaking of bone marrow, you've got to try them here!!  We will be back to the Public house. For the bone marrow, for the bee knees cocktail (delicious ) and for the spectacular service from Arnie !"
0,"Hugely disappointing. Big fans & frequent customers of the Tatum/Shea location for years. This new concept is a bust. Small portions, limited food options, plastic ware everywhere. Sad to say - we won't be back."
0,"The website and video is deceiving. \n\nWhen you actually get  inside its super small. I think the max capacity is 15 people. We paid the general admission fee which came out to be about $16 after taxes.  The admission fee includes the parka, gloves, disposable booties and boots. There isnt much of a wow factor to this place besides the fact that everything is made of ice. The video hyped it up too much. \n\nThe photographer caught me and my friend taking pictures with our camera phones so that was our cue to take off. They charge if you want their photographer to take pictures of you. Anyways, I dont think its worth it to come here. I rather spend my money on another drink."
0,If I could leave no stars then I would! Came in after NBA playoffs in Charlotte and it was empty. We had to wait to get a table and then wait forever for the server who was the most unfriendly I've encountered. My friend with me frequents this spot during lunch hour and raved about how good it was.. Well clearly the lunch staff doesn't work at night. The server was in a hurry to go nowhere. Food was mediocre at best. I could have gone to Soho Bistro and had great food for half the money.. Definitely my first and last time.. #awfultasteSTILLinmymouth
0,"wow, where do I begin?  It took us an hour and a half to check in.  Our first room appeared to have been ransacked.  Beer bottle caps on the floor, the items from the cabinet were strewn all over the floor, beds unmade , towels everywhere, extremely dusty on the tables, a HOT mess.  The next room (which was an upgrade)  had been shampooed that morning, so the carpet was  WET....very WET.. tried to call the front desk and waited for over 30 minutes with no answer.  So, had to go back down to the front desk and  while they apologized, it took them about 15 minutes for them come back and tell us what we were going to receive.  (2 free buffet meals).  The service at the HOTEL in general was horrible.  From the front desk, the phone service, the waitresses at the pool, even the server at PRICE MARKET (the buffet restaurant).  The hallways were ALWAYS dirty.  This place is a hot mess. Yes, there are some perks... but geez, had to go through so much to receive them."
0,Unfortunately this place isn't what I was hoping for. The food is good and the cooks are great but front of house is really not knowledgable on their food. This is suppose to be a health kitchen so they should be able to modify my meals to what I need but simply don't know how. When asked what kind of squash is in one of ther signature dishes their response is idk. How do you not know? And if you don't why can't you find out? Same thing when asked what white dishes do you guys have? Is there oil in that sauce? What about sugar? These things are important for people on specific meal plans. It's frustrating when you do not know anything and seem too annoyed to find out. Though the food is good I'm afraid to eat it in fear that it will have something I specified I can't have. Both times I've been here had the same issue with the same girl. They need to be more knowledgable.
0,"This is the Italian Restaurant for the Wynn. Started with a couple appetizers for thew whole table, calamari and bruschetta. Easy enough, right.? Well not so easy for this place. The calamari looked like the phony calamari (pig intestines deep fried) with each and every piece looking identical. And it was rubbery and served luke warm. The bruschetta was even worse. Two pieces of stale, cold toast,one topped with a tomato slice and a piece of cheese, the other had a slice of tomato, and some sort of potato sausage ball sliced into four cubes. I quit there,and did not even order a main course. \n\nPlease Steve, get someone in there who knows how to cook!!"
1,I love this place! It's walking distance from my office that service delicious fast food.\n\nIt's a great place to grab a quick freshly made breakfast burrito or sandwich.\n\nThe lunch is very good too! They have a daily special that includes a side and a drink and they have good homemade type sandwiches. My personal favorites are the Korean BBQ Sandwich and they make an awesome tuna salad sandwich!\n\nTell them I sent ya!
0,"The park/playground is excellent. Lots of trees, nice lake area, picnic ramadas, splash pad, etc. The train is another story. We spent almost $40 for tickets for our large family to ride the train. The train broke. No big deal, we'll just get a refund and enjoy the rest of our day, right? NOPE. Train tickets are non-refundable, apparently even when the train is broken. No apology. Nothing. We live 50 miles away so it's not like we can just drop by the next day. So now I'm stuck with 40 bucks of useless train tickets that will never get used and a bad taste in my mouth for this otherwise great park."
1,"A group of us went to get pedicures and we were absolutely thrilled!  We had 7 people and I had originally called for an appointment for 5, but they were very gracious and were able to fit all of us in at the same time.

1,"Sure it's a giant Hershey's store...but there's a lot of interesting things in the store that you don't see in regular stores that sell Hershey's products.\n\nThe setup is similar...VERY similar to the M&M's store across the street (brah, you have a competitor now!), except this store features a bakery and a photo booth instead of a movie screening and...I guess statues where you can take photos with.\n\nEverything in this store is chocolate related, not surprisingly. They even have a Hershey's statue of the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty, which is quite chocolate-ly delicious.\n\nEven if you're not planning to buy something in this store, do at least pay a visit here just because it's something Vegas has (many people visit the M&M store across the street for the hell of it, why not here?)."

1,"I really liked this restaurant..  It's fresh, a little on the trendy side. Casual enough just for a quick nice lunch or dinner out.

I will definitely go back.\n\nfun time"

0,"Oh god wasnt paying attention and this is my 200th review......\n\nYeah i'd seriously wouldnt recommend this place to anyone. We only went here due to it being a Sunday and all the major hot spots were closed (Stephano's, 28Go, that taco place). \n\nService was alright considering there's only one person on staff to man both the drinks and front counter and the kitchen in the back. That could account of the quality of the food but if they knew there was only going to be one person then the food could have been prepared and if it was could also account for it's quality.\n\nFusion Fries\n - seriously almost 7 dollars for frozen fries with sauce, mayo, and rice topping sprinkles. SEVEN DOLLARS!! at most it's worth 3.95! portion size wasnt even that big!\n\nPork Belly on rice (daily special)\n - Wow seriously the blandest pork belly i've ever had. Waste of what could have been bacon. Not sure if it's suppose to taste like nothing but it tasted like....nothing. Even the chunks of pork belly which has the fat had any flavor to it.\n\nCurry Rice w/Chicken Katsu\n - The chicken was pretty decent. Dark meat and had a nice crunchy crust and they even seasoned the chicken with a little salt. The rest of it was meh. Potato salad was halfway cooked containing bits of still raw potato hunks. Curry was Golden brand brick instant curry and is there a shortage of the stuff? When that nuclear reactor blew up did it take out the curry brick factory? When you think of Katsu Curry you're expecting a bowl with just all curry sauce, in island of rice, and a few strips of fried chicken slightly submerged in the curry. Nope exact opposite here. Mountains of rice with just a light mist of curry.\n\nExpensive too. WAY expensive. When your target market are college students your strategy should be cheap and plentiful so they keep coming back. 3pm Cafe is neither cheap nor is it very plentiful."
1,"Was awesome?!?! Went just to hike for fun and happened that there was a moonlight hike at 730. So our hike lead us to the moonlight hike at perfect time and to say the least very neat experience, interesting history and gave us Blacklight's to see scorpions glow in the dark! We will be back."
0,"We've been using Elite Pest Control (apparently they'll wash your windows too! THATS COMFORTING...) since we moved into our house about a year and half ago. The main reason is because our property backs up to land under control of the county called \""BLM\"" (the Bureau of Land Management). We have a nasty bee problem with a hive or more than just one hive on that land and apparently this is the only company that BLM \""trusts\"". \n\nWe've called for them to come and spray around our house and yard several times over the past year and a half and have requested again and again, finally demanding that they work with BLM to fix the problem with the bees. They have come out to us once. And I truly believe it was BLM that forced them to and they're no picnic to deal with either. \n\nI scheduled an appointment for today for which I was under the assumption would be between noon and 2:30pm. That's not an unreasonable window of time in my opinion even though I may have other things to do during the day than sit around my house and wait for no phone calls. At 2pm I decided to call their office just to be sure the appointment was correct. A very nice lady answered and confirmed that I had an appointment but it was from 2-3pm. Oh that's fine, I can wait a little longer, must have been miscommunication on my part, so sorry for inconveniencing you! Not at all sir, have a wonderful day! Thank you! You do the same! \n\n3pm came and went. I called back. Straight to voicemail. Called again. Voicemail. I called 6 times. Voicemail every time. In an office. At 3pm on a WEDNESDAY. There's no excuse for that. It is now 6pm, they're closed unless they all decided to leave at 3 anyway, I mean, WHY NOT!? I've been waiting at my home all day. I think this is the straw to break the camels back. \n\nI'm trying this new thing called \""looking on the bright side\"" and this stupid company is making that really difficult for me. I don't know, the idea of sitting inside on a beautiful 70 degree autumn afternoon on my day off with the combination of bees and crickets and ants and scorpions and spiders and grasshoppers and roaches having a fuckin party outside and no \""ELITE\"" pest control (AND WINDOW WASHING TOO!!!) to perform the duties that their service suggests they might do... But only if they feel like it... I don't think I'm so crazy after all for saying that this company is a complete joke. They're a waste of time. They're pitiful and I truly hope they all wake up one day and realize that their lives are pathetic and worthless. \n\nELITE Pest Control. HA! There is NOTHING elite about them. Unless they want to eliminate their own pest problems!! Or if they need a window washed.... Stupid company."
1,"ambiance...good.  service...good.  sake...good.  food...good.  we started out with a chilled sake (i'm not sure with one it was...they have a big selection). they have a fall tasting menu that gives you selections for 3 courses with an added desert.  i had the edamame in sea salt, kyoto miso soup, the rock shrimp tempura with spicy aioli , and the black angus beef tenderloin with roasted japanese mushrooms and black truffle ponzu with green tea cake to top it all off.  it was all good and left me wanting more.  although i was pretty stuffed.  it also helped that it was good company as well!"
1,"...and the Five stars are not only because we've known the owners, Ray and Lynn for 20 years...as well as grinding there for just as long.  The food is always island style...which means broke da mouth, bruddahs and sistahs.  And Aloha Kitchen is always the busiest food kiosk at the Annual March Arizona Aloha Festival, for the past 8-10 years I can recall.  (The Aloha Festival is now held at Tempe Town Lake.)  So if you cannot get out to Mesa to check 'em out there, you can stand in line at the upcoming Aloha Festival...you won't be disappointed!  There have been many Hawaiian food establishments that have come into the valley since, Ray and Lynn opened over 20 years ago.   and, there are lots of good reasons (on their menu) why they are still serving ono-licious Hawaiian style food...its da sticky rice, brah....naw only keeding....Its da food!  Try 'em!"
1,"The place was a bit tough to find, but we eventually found it. It's inside the O'Aces, as the previous reviewer stated. I went with a coworker around noon and we were the only ones in the restaurant. Although it's inside O'Aces, it did feel like a separate establishment. The decor was nice and it felt like an actual restaurant, not a sports bar or dive bar. There were three small flat screens spread throughout the walls of the dining room on various sports channels, so that was a plus for me since I'm a huge sports fan.\n\nThe service was excellent. Our waiter was very nice and friendly. She was attentive to when we needed drink refills and took it upon herself to give us refills before we had to ask. I had the stromboli and my coworker had the chicken fingers. Not the best stromboli I've ever had (that honor goes to Four Kegs), but it was really good. The portion size was good, and came with a side of marinara for dipping. The chef also came out to ask us how the food was. I thought that was a nice touch.\n\nThe prices were fairly reasonable, but we used Groupon Now vouchers, so it ended up being a great deal. They had no problem with us using two vouchers for one table. Some places limit Groupon usage to one per table, but not here.\n\nPaparazzi Grill is definitely a place I will return to."

1,"Salvatore's is HERE IN MADISON! Woohoo, the Yelp favorite pizza is here!! Let's cheer! No more driving to Sun Prairie for Salvatores!\n\nI was surprised by the size of Salvatore's, maybe 8 tables or so, and the bar area is small. So, I was really thankful to visit on a weekday, when I didn't need to wait for seats, and food didn't take too long to arrive. If you're lost, it's right next to Johnson Public House, and have pizza board with skulls saying Wisco on them (So hipster :p)!\n\nThe menu has great selections - lots of appetizers, make your own pizza, specialty pizza and tacos!!! Pretty excited about all these things. Also, there's a good selection of beer and non-alcoholic drinks. \n\nI loved the carbonara pizza - eggs, bacon, cheese. my FAVORITE THINGS. AND, how is it possible that ALL 3 eggs were RUNNY. Such an amazing creamy, rich flavor with runny yolks! The crust of the pizza is thin crust, though not italian thin, but has great chew to it. (P.S. the ~8\""/$14 pizza was so big, we had some leftovers; the leftovers were AMAZING. just heat them up in the oven. oooohhhhh good)\n\nWe also tried the bacon and cheese bread (even though it was similar to our pizza..), the sriracha sauce added some much flavor and depth! LOVE IT. \n\nDefinitely gonna be visiting very soon again! How about some delivery very soon??? Please? :D"
1,This place is amazing! They have the best acai and pitaya bowls in town. Their servings are very generous compared to most places and they have great service. Try this place and you won't be disappointed.
0,"The food was excellent- P B and J waffle w compote and the Hangover sandwich. But the service was terrible , too many servers trying to service Everyone With no coordination between them. It took way too long-  they brought the wrong coffee and then replaced it w the correct one and charged for both . Manager was too busy trying to explain the mistakes away instead of acknowledging the problems and apologizing  or god forbid comping us for the coffee. Too bad the service seriously detracted from the creativity and qualitivity of the food .\nWon 't be back."

1,"New location seems to be the same as the old location in terms of quality of food. Menu is a bit confusing if you're trying to make your own, but I always get the mochiko bento with kimchee fried rice so that's quite easy to order."
1,"This place was a pleasant surprise.  I had \""linner\"" here at 3:00pm on a Sunday.  I was impressed with several things about this place:\n\n1.  The menu is amazing.  Not just the standard \""commercial Mexican\"" fare; they have a couple of Cuban, Puerto Rican, Peruvian, and other Latin dishes, so you are not limited to Mexican alone.  They also have an extensive drink menu.\n\n2.  Atmosphere is great - bright, energetic decor, fun environment, nice bar, open-concept design.  It's a nice place to hang out.\n\n3.  The quality of the food is really good, and so is the selction.  \n\n4.  The service is good.  I was there at a weird time, and they only had 2 servers, and there were quite a few tables of people eating.  They were busy, but they still did a good job.  I'm sure that, during peak times, they are well-staffed and attentive.\n\nI had the Arrachera, which I haven't seen on a menu since my last trip to Celaya, Mexico.  It was excellent.  The beans and rice were very good, and the meat was grilled with bell pepper, onion, and jalapenos.  They served it with a salsa that was insanely spicy.  Probably a bit much for most people, but SOOOOOO good!  The combo of the jalapeno strips and the salsa had my mouth on fire for a while.  A true Mexican experience!"
0,"Hmm, wasn't quite a fan.  Perhaps it was the fact that my Reuben omelette was not altogether tasty and neither was my boyfriend's corned beef.  Still, I appreciate the ginormous portions and the cute setting."
1,"Driving into downtown Glendale - I felt like I was cheating on my beloved Haus Murphy's. I secretly promised I would venture back to the area soon to visit Haus, but I soon recovered from my guilt when I tasted the Bruschette. Delicious. This place is really great! The pizza very tasty, we had the Stallion pizza - or the meat pizza. It was a little spicy and very meaty. So great. Also very inexpensive. (26 before tip for one pizza, one appetizer and two sodas, dinner for two). The sodas are also great - bottled coke products (1 liter bottles). Highly recommend. (We will be going back to Haus in the next week . . . and also back for pizza soon!)"
1,"Best home cooked Italian joint in NC so far.  Their special was awesome!  I wanted to get the Shrimp Scampi, but they had a special with shrimp and scallops and I couldn't so no.  Glad I didn't.  Absolutely the best thing ever.  Give this place a  try!"
1,"Constellation is perfect! The shop is bright and welcoming. Simple, but not plain.\nNo-frills coffee menu (all the necessities), pies and small snacks. Amy is so knowledgeable about her products, not to mention a pleasure to sit and chat with. Pick up a bag of Ceremony beans while you're at it. \n\nBy far my favorite coffee shop in Pittsburgh. 10/10, highly recommend."
1,"As a tourist in Scotland, I was curious about haggis.  I'm Asian, so I guess you could say I'll eat about anything (and I pride myself on having an iron stomach--food poisoning, what's that?), but I thought I might have to draw the line at haggis.\n\nThen a local told me that Henderson's is the place to go.  Not only is it vegetarian, but they have a veggie version of haggis that supposedly tastes \""just like the real thing.\""  \n\nSo, we went there and it was fabulous.  It's a small-ish place, but everything was flavorful and just what our starving bellies needed.  Oh, and yes, I got the veggie haggis.  Totally awesome and filling.  I think the texture was nothing like the real thing, but at least now I know what haggis is \""supposed\"" to taste like.  \n\nFriendly staff, great food.  What more can you ask for?  Don't even hesitate if you're a carnivore.  You'll be more than satisfied and you'll probably leave with a whole new appreciation of vegetarian food."
0,1) Hard to get in and out of for gas due to the active car wash and the dozen car wash employees running around all over the place.  \n\n2) Since it's right next to a major bus stop it's not uncommon for you to get hit up for cash by a vagrant.\n\n3) Pump system is easy to use and up to date.  You just have to answer a ton of yes/no questions on up-sells before you can pump gas... so don't come if you're in a hurry.
0,"So i have a blended family lol this place was my boyfriends groomer so i decided to give them a chance. I called to see if we could get a deal since we would be bringing 3 dogs. I was told on the phone $105 for all three so i made the appointment. I go to pick my furchildren up and the women says $130. I then go on to tell her the price i was quoted she snapped back \"" if they quoted you that, they should have done your dogs\"" etc. that attitude persist throughout the transaction. My boyfriend at this time is beyond annoyed. I tell her well thats what was quoted otherwise we would have went elsewhere. She counters with $110. But the issue was with the younger black women chiming in rolling her eyes and saying \""thats the cheapest u'll find, thats $20 a dog\"" of course i commented on her inability to add obviously $20x3 pups does not equal $110 or $105. Just overall horrible experience and if they treat their customers with such disrespect i can only wonder how they treat the pups"
0,"Everyone runs into a poor experience now and then, and I guess we just didn't click as store and customer.  Ok, enough of the pen jokes.\n\nNot appearing too concerned that the defective Visconti Traveling Ink Pot had leaked all over me and I did indeed walk around with blue fingers for days, the thing that irked me into a two star review is that the owner waited a week to contact Visconti to get a replacement that apparently never came.  \n\nWhen you charge someone MSRP for one of these items, you tend to expect service if the unit is defective.  I must be on another planet to expect this, so I wound up contacting the Visconti distributor directly and have wound up spending an extra $20 for shipping outbound and return to Planet Phoenix.\n\nHey, my Kon-Peki blue fingers don't look too bad, anyway; it might even be good to scare the TSA folks as I check in tomorrow ;)"
0,"In July 2011, the hubby bought a 3D Sharp TV at Frys.  We don't usually go for the extended warranty but on a purchase of this price range, he let agreed to the extended warranty.  I would say it's a good thing we did because a few weeks ago our TV decided to have a bright blue vertical line in the picture.  Tried calling the customer service number at Frys for the warranty for a week.  When he did speak with someone he was told that someone would have to be getting back to him.  They never did.  He finally went to Frys in person.  First speaking to one of the folks at the returns desk.  I took a little video of her shrugging her shoulders and saying she didn't know why no one had called back before a manager came over and said \""no photo or video is allowed\"".  The manager went on to say that the customer service calls were all routed to a call center in Santa Rosa.\n\nWell, obviously the call center in Santa Rosa is a dead end zone.  The in store customer service guy was able to get someone on the phone who did schedule one of their local contractors to come out and evaluate the TV.  The guys who came out seemed experienced and said the problem is the main board.  Too bad the customer service folks at Frys aren't as good as their independent contractors.  \n\nAfter hearing nothing for a few days, we got in touch with the contractors.  They said Frys had denied the repairs because it would be cheaper to replace the TV.  So we began trying to find out when and how they're going to replace it.  We cannot get anyone to communicate with us regarding this issue.  Yesterday when the hubby stopped by the store, the customer service guy was put on hold for ten minutes and finally someone got back to him that they would be in touch with us.\n\nThis is the WORST customer service I have ever seen.  Trust me, do not shop at FRYS Electronics for any big ticket items.  I would not give them even one star if Yelp would allow it.  The final insult is they sell their extended warranties based on the idea that if something breaks down they'll fix it there and/or bring it in and get it replaced.  What a joke!"
0,"I only come here to get my eyebrows waxed. This is the place i'll go to if I don't want to drive to far to get my eyebrows done. They usually do a great job for $8, but recently they have been doing horrible. I do not recommend you coming here for your eyebrows\n\nI also came here with a friend who wanted to get stiletto nails (pointy nails). They looked horrible, she had to go to her usual spot and get the nails removed and redone."
0,"I rarely review services unless I find it absolutely worth my time to either rant or rave. I will say this much... The store itself is fine. It is clean, bright, and well-stocked. The associates were all very friendly, minus a little Miss Mindy. And it just so happens she was the one to help me with my transaction. She was rude (\""Well, I told you the iPhone would come out to $88 after taxes before I went to the back to get it!\""), degrading (\""Why do you want International access? You wanna call Mexico or something?\""), and bossy (\""Don't touch that or the security sensor will go off.\"") Well, my dear, that is what you are there for. In the event that the alarm goes off on one of your non-operable display phones, those little keys you keep around your wrist on the spiral chain to make yourself look important are used to stop the alarm. I truly hope a manager reads posted reviews regarding their stores, because Miss Mindy needs ettiquette classes. I understand the economy is tough right now, but Lord Almighty, if you hate your job that much, try to find another. As I was leaving, the other associates looked as if they wanted to say, \""We're so sorry\"". Well, AT&T friends, I'm even more sorry you have to spend 8 hours a day with the witch."
1,"I spent 10 days in Kitchener on business, and this place was right across the street from my hotel.  I had dinner there several nights.  The first night I arrived late (11 pm) and there were still lots of customers.  I found a good IPA and had fish and chips -- 4 stars.  The second time I had the nachos.  The order was huge and good, but needed jalape\u00f1os and guacamole -- 3 stars.  Third night I had a prime rib burger.  Good but not great , overcooked and dry-- 2 stars.\n\nSo why do I rate it 4 stars?  Good service, good atmosphere, and a great beer selection!"
1,Monica was super kind and helpful! I highly recommend renting a storage unit at this location. The staff is great!
1,I've always been impressed with the service at this location. The wait staff is always super friendly and always quick when you need something. The food is amazing every time. The endless shrimp and lobster fest deals get me coming back every year when I see the commercials on TV.
1,"We just moved back to Vegas after a 5 year hiatus away.. We were looking for a reasonable priced barber shop. I live with the cheapest person on earth when it comes to himself... and I found this barber shop on yelp with 5 stars.. So I thought why not..\n\nOff we went. Now you have to understand the man who needs this haircut is 67 years old, has no tats, is extremely conservative yet open to checking things out.. so when we walked in and there were 5 guys waiting and each of them had a variety of tats and different types of haircuts.. He said.. what the heck.. this place has a great vibe, lets see what they can do.. \n\nHe checked out the barbers and really liked what Brad seemed to be.. we sat a while (45 minutes actually, which isn't easy for him to do so he must of really liked the vibe).\n\nThis place is like the old fashion barber shops but with a twist!\n\nWhen it was his turn, Brad was available so he sat in Brad's chair. Within minutes they were talking and chatting up a storm.. As much as Brad's appointment before was all pimped out, he took the time with K and gave him a really nice \""conservative\"" hair cut, trimmed his beard and even gave him a senior discount.. K was happy, and so was I. (Which isn't an easy thing to do!!!)\n\nThis is for all the conservative men out there that are sometimes put off by unconventional places... Don't be put off by the alternative feel of the place, this place really \""rocks\"" even for seniors without tats... lol..."
1,"The restaurant has a very nice atmosphere. They have happy hour from 5-8 pm, you can actually try different Brazilian appetizer as their menu is pretty decent. You can also have all you can eat salad bar or all you can ate meats. their food is pretty tasty. I still prefer Texas de Brazil but If you don't want to drive far this place is a good option."
1,"Caught a quick bite to eat here the other day while staying at the Encore.  Absolutely delicious food!  As I found out during my stay at the Encore, the food at all of the establishments were amazing.  Service was great.  I would not recommend for date night as it is a little more open and not as private or contains a great ambiance.  But the food was delectable and I would definitely return.  Stop by for lunch!"
0,"Do not let the PF Chang's ownership fool you into believing their cuisine is any better than Panda Express. Essentially it's the same thing but at a higher price and slower service. And with Panda setting the bar very low for Chinese food,  Pei Wei is subterranean on the quality scale. \n\nSpecifically, the dishes are extremely salty, way too sweet and greasy. Yes, that's the definition of American cooking. But it still sucks. And rounding out their Americana - they deep fry the Kung Pow'ed chicken. I guess with a few token snow peas mixed with the fried rice, this fast food appears more Hoity-Toity than a Swanson Oriental TV Dinner from Walmart, but don't be fooled by marketing and mid-range pricing."

0,"Went here for lunch on Monday - arrived around 11:30am and were one of two tables in the entire place. Despite opening at 11:00am, the overhead lights were still off - they turned them on as we sat down.\n\nThe hostess/waitress/cashier lady didn't greet us; she handed us two sets of menus and grunted something about sitting wherever we wanted to.  We grabbed a table (which was sticky in spots) and browsed the menu.\n\nAfter a brief wait, the same lady stopped by to drop off water glasses and to take our order: spring rolls (with meat), tofu Pad Thai, and Tofu curry (with potatoes, onion, and coconut milk). \n\nThe spring rolls arrived; I'm guessing they had been pre-made some time ahead. They were ice cold and nearly glued to one another. The lettuce was brown on the edges. As I grabbed for the hot sauce, I noticed the spoon was filthy and sticky. The same held true for the soy sauce vessel. Hmmm....\n\nThe Pad Thai had an awesome texture and a great flavor - I really enjoyed it. The curry was tasty - light on spice despite ordering 3-stars, but good.\n\nWe waited a long, long time for a check. After watching another table walk up to the front cash register and then hunt down the absent hostess/waitress/cashier, we walked-up to pay and to get some to-go containers (the portions were massive). We got a grunt or two from the woman; nothing much else.\n\nSo... Vientiane = MEH\n\nFood = 3 stars (entrees were good; spring rolls were sub-par)\nService = 1 star\nValue = 3 stars (lunch specials were a bargain)\nMISC = 1 star (dirty, rundown inside)\n\nMadison is hurting for good Thai places... this one has some potential, but needs to improve in some key areas."

It was almost 10 minutes to get our drink order in.  They were reasonably busy but not too busy.  The food was OK.  Not bad.  Not great.  I could tell my vegetables were frozen, not fresh.  I had to ask for my salad after my meal had already come.  Service was slow through the meal...ask for ketchup...wait until the waiter saw us and remembered...etc.\n\nWe plan to give them some more time and go back and I'll revise my review then.

We called ahead to ensure there was a good non-alc sparkling wine for my pregnant significant other who is normally a wine connoisseur (when not with child).  When we called ahead to attempt to bring in our own bottle they said they had some NA Sparkling Champagne...when we get there they whip out a freaking bottle of Martinellis Cider????\n\nAnother person in our party was the smart one and got a steak a la carte - bone in rib eye which was juicy and perfectly seasoned.  I got the Pri Fix Rib Eye which was disappointing...looked like a cut of steak you can get from Vons in the family pack.  Crab cake was good-right amount of crab (Blue) to binding portion.  Again small bite on the tasting menu, was sooo tempted to get a full order.\n\nMy general rule is to try a place more than once before ruling it out, so the crab cake was definitely enough to bring me back for another try at their Steak."

I am NOT a common dullard that can be lulled in because of some clever commercials... you wings suck!\n\nThey do have huge TV's everywhere and the service is okay... but so what!\n\nReasons for not liking this place;\n\n1.  There wings suck!  Tiny little chicken wings.  They get tough with out being crispy.  Then they are drenched in some super sweet sauce of what ever... For $9 you get 12 tiny little wings served in a paper dish.\n\n2.  The chicken tenders are terrible.  They taste like something you would get at a skating rink or some terrible concession stand.  They were not \""tenders\"" as billed on the menu.  These were pieces of chicken all wadded up and super heavily breaded.  The blue cheese dressing had no blue cheese.  Ask me how I know there was no blue cheese...  \""Jason how do you know there was NO blue cheese in the dressing?\""  Well, becuase blue cheese is blue and it should be visible in a white sauce...\n\n3.  Afterpaying $19 for tenders and wings there were 3 small paper containers of food on the table.  I want something more substantial for $19.  A measly offering of low quality chicken products served in cheap paper boats is just bad...  Again - I will not be fooled!\n\n4.  I paid $5.75 for a regular size Blue Moon.  Maybe my exwife is right, maybe I am cheap!  But $5.75 for a regular size beer???  \n\nI am still pissed off - I hate this place.

They also make great cappucinos.  Most of the restaurants in this terminal all had salads premade in plastic boxes that looked identical.  Press Coffee made the salad fresh and it was outstanding.

0,"Summary: great location, great micro brew, really good appetizers. So why the 2 stars? Horrible service. \n\nAdvice: if you are waiting for a show, this is not the place to go if you want to watch the beginning of your movie. \n\nI will check back in a month or two. We showed up to have a couple beers and an appetizer before going to the show a couple doors down. Turns out that they opened their doors earlier in the week. We let our waiter know that we were watching the clock for the show bit it didn't help. We had to rush to get out and was still a couple minutes late. \n\nSince they were open for less then a week I am more then willing to give them another chance. They have 5-6 microbrews and give a solid score on all. Their appetizers, amazing. Try the pretzels."
0,"The pits man. my omelette was so watery and the \""vegetables\"" were sparse and looked like they were canned. Our server lacked knowledge about the menu too. boo"
0,I remember this place as Narita... And that was a good place.  Arata not so much. All I can say is I'm so sorry I stopped by here. The food was mediocre. I ordered a roll and chicken teriyaki. I know what chicken teriyaki is and what it tastes like. This was not chicken teriyaki. It was some kind of oil drenched fried chicken and I'm not sure if the pan that they used had been cleaned or if it was their version of chicken teriyaki but all I could taste was grease and garlic. I ended up eating the salad and leaving. I hope I don't get sick!
1,"I'm a huge fan of the Farm Kitchen on Maya's farm.   I frequent the farm businesses and I am a CSA member of the farm itself.  So, of course, I have very high marks for this farm in general.  \n\nThe Farm Kitchen is a casual dining experience suitable for a date picnic or girlfriends lunch in an open air patio with quaint picnic baskets to boot.\n\nFor the novice visitor to Maya's Farm, there are 3 restaurants.  The Farm Kitchen is in the \""Little house\"" at the right of the driveway on to the farm.  This season, they stopped allowing cars to park along the drive to the back of the farm where the 2 other restaurants (Quiessence and Morning Glory Cafe).  Now when you come to visit The Kitchen, you have to park in the parking lot on the east side of 32nd street and walk across.\n\nonce you enter into the Farm Kitchen, you are greeted with the aroma of some amazing baking or cooking.  It always smells so wonderful in there.  You will find some local food items in the store, even down to the locally made Poore Brother potatoe chips!  LOCAL LOCAL LOCAL.  Inside the Kitchen, you place your order from a menu that is loaded with your choice of sandwiches, salads, flavored teas, and soups.  They normally have an array of desserts to choose from as well.  I personally love the buttner squash creme brulee.\n\nOnce you place your order, you go outside and wait for your number to be called.  Once your food is ready, you can choose to sit on the patio or venture over to the picnic tables or spread your own blanket and eat your food under the pecan trees.\n\nOne thing of note;  you can schedule baby showers, et al with the kitchen.\n\nMy personal favorites on this menu are:\nTuscan Chicken Sandwich\nItalian Sandwich\nAny of their broth based soups.  \nButternut Squash Creme Brulee\nChocolate Chip Cookies"
0,"Stayed there in 2009, the room was old, dark and ugly. If you're planning on staying there, better  to go to Signature MGM, which is much nicer. Just 5 mins walk from the MGM Grand. At least it's at a great location."

0,"I will NEVER eat here again. I was not told that there was no half price sushi or specials on Valentine's Day. The waitress never expressed that all you can eat sushi may be a better option since there were no specials. Got the check and talked to the manager who said they changed happy hours a month ago. Waitress came back to ask what the problem was, I stated that I was upset and why. She then proceeded to say happy hours were changed 6 months ago. I don't know who was right, but no one offered to make it better. Paid the check and I stated I'd never be back. I PROMISE I will never go back. Overpriced and lack of a caring staff = unhappy customer."

0,"Arizona Mills has the worst bathrooms I have ever been in. They are always really, really smelly and warm.\n\nI like that there are outlet stores, so you can save a lot of money, but at the same time some of the stores they have are really ghetto and a lot of the outlets have ghetto items.\n\nThe mall is always really packed and there are a ton of kids running around. People walk on the wrong side of the mall, or walk in large groups that prevent people from getting by.\n\nAnd the worst part: there are at least ten different cell phone kiosks and you get badgered every time you walk by. They wont leave you alone. They also have two or three of those carts that sell lotion. I have had people chase me into stores trying to get me to buy natural sea potions. It's just annoying and always makes my shopping experience uncomfortable."
0,"I took my daughter here and it was a very bad experience. The two men were very opinionated about their conservative politics and imposed their views on us, plus the haircut was bad."
1,This is a family restaurant and has pretty much everything on the menu and some Greek goodies as well. I had their special pork tips with rice. It was definitely YUM!! The portion was huge. The seating area is clean and our server was quite pleasant.
0,"We went to Top Shelf because we had a coupon from our Entertainment book for a buy one, get one free entree.  When we got to the restaurant, we hung out in the waiting area for a few minutes before the hostess came to seat us, but we enjoyed looking at the fish tank while we waited.  Our waitress was nice and kept our drinks filled and the food was pretty good, but maybe a little pricey for the portions.  When the bill came, we gave the waitress our coupon.  She brought back the bill and our kid's meal was the one given to us free.  When we asked, she said she tried to give us the second adult entree as the free meal, but the manager wouldn't let her.  She then had the manager come talk to us, but he wouldn't budge on the matter.  I have never been to a restaurant that considers a kid's meal to be an entree.  It seems this company is more concerned with making a couple bucks than good service that brings back return customers."
0,"I have to say, I am mad at the entire company now. To describe the whole situation in short: I went to the store to buy a vest, one consultant referred me to another, I waited to be serviced for 20 minutes, because the ladies were making service calls and thought I was waiting for someone/something else (?). Finally I've purchased the vest and paid for expedited delivery ($70). Next day I came to pick it up and to find out I paid for a rental! I started discussing the subject with staff - I couldn't go get a vest somewhere else now because this was the day of the event I needed it for. Nothing but blank faces, clueless, not knowing how to react. The sales person who I made the \""purchase\"" from only said - \""what do you want me to do now?\"" Finally someone came - probably manager and said that we can pretend I lost the vest and for extra $60 I can keep it.... $130 vest???\n\nJust went online today to file a complaint. To file via email they only provide an online form. When I filled out the form and pushed the submit button, I've received an error message saying - Service not available...what? Tried with different browsers, figured - maybe my complaint is too long, tried to shorten it, talked to Live Service - of course NO HELP! Should a customer really work so hard just to give feedback???\n\nThough to summarize the impression: very friendly! BUT poor consultation + terrible service + horrible complaint management = very dissatisfied customer!"
1,I love wine and beer...there aren't too many places where I WANT to order a drink.  Herbs & Rye is one of them!\n\nFell in love with the aviation here and have lost track of the gin drinks I have sense enjoyed here.\n\nCurrent favorite drink here is the Brown Derby (Bourbon/Honey/Grapefruit/Yum) \n\nH&R has a nice vintage/hipster feel to it.
0,"i just don't see the big deal with this place. i've heard about it for years and was actually excited to go here. and i do love to bet on the horses as well and they have off track betting. yes, there is alot of sports memorabilia, mostly college. lots of helmets in display cases. the bar itself feels dirty to me. it's dark and no frills at all. the tables and chairs are below average or average at best. the tvs suck. they have small tvs up towards the ceiling so your neck is cranked up. they have 2 large tvs that are kind of dark. there will usually be a couple of groups hogging those 2 big tvs, so if you want to see your game, you'll be stuck looking up at a small tv and those are usually a little dark or blurred. they have a separate area for horse betters. i don't like that they charge you to sit in that room. the only place to sit in that room is at your own personal tv like the 2nd level at turf paradise, so they charge you to sit there. the food was ok. we were there on a friday for all you can eat fish. well, after ordering several rounds, we found out it wasn't all you can eat. we had to pay for all of it. come on, 99% of places have it as all you can eat fish fry on fridays. the beer was cheaper. i have no idea about mixed drinks. the only reason i would go here is to walk in, look at the memorabilia and leave. also, if you have a large group, i would recommend somewhere else. these tables are small and you would have to push together a few tables. the bar only has a small area of tables."
0,"I love Tom Colicchio and Craft Restaurant but unfortunately I was not impressed with his sandwich place. Maybe I should have ordered the goat cheese, avocado and watercress cold sammy but I went with the one of the grilled sandwiches that my friend wanted which was a disappointment. We each ordered a grilled sandwich but they both had way too much cheese in addition to butter on each side of the bread so all you taste is fat!!! They were too heavy to even finish. It would be nice to see some more vegetarian options that use fresh veggies and not just cheese and a tiny bit of pear or a tiny smear of some tomato coulis. I'm sure the bread is good on its own so if you are going to try this place don't go for the grilled sandwiches b/c they smear butter all over the bread which masks the taste of the bread. I would def go back if I was at the MGM to try a cold sammy but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back here. \n\nWe also ordered 3 sandwich style cookies - the peanut butter one was AMAZING!! My friend LOVED the oatmeal one. But neither of us liked the chocolate one. It was much too rich and I like dark chocolate normally but this was too much. I think it would have been good if it was more like Oreo with vanilla filling. A chocolate cookie with a peanut butter filling would also be a very nice addition to the cookie choices!"
0,"Huge fan of Gordon Ramsay, however the hells kitchen burger I ordered was not as expected. I ordered to go and waited half an hour for my food to arrive. When I bit into the burger it was overly salty, as if the person who was seasoning the meat dropped a whole canister of salt into the patty. It's probably because I ordered around 11:45pm and they close at 12am so they didn't care about the standards and said \""f\"" it, they can't complain after we close. So disappointed."
0,"2 drinks, one salad, one bread and one appetizer for $60. Are you kidding me. A small dinner portion salad, ceviche that dis not have marinated shrimp and 2.50 for a small bread. We are used to pay for great food and small portions but not small salads by a movie theatre. No wonder the owners are just hanging out and the place is not as busy for a Friday night. Shame on you for treating your customers like this."
1,"Despite the \""roach situation\"" I finally gave this one a try. It was very good, not great. Typically the first time I try a pizza joint I go with just straight pepperoni, this time was no exception. I always feel that if a place can get the basics right then I am willing to venture out and try something a little more.... exotic.\n\nThe crust was good, the cheese very good, not much in the way of sauce. Worth trying however I still prefer chicago style pizza. If it is't cut in squares, it isn't pizza:)"
0,"Haven't been here in a while and service not good tonight.  Husband had to go in to flag someone down for water after a long wait, an abnormally long wait on the patio.  It wasnt even busy so after the waitress made initial visit to our table she didnt come back to check on us for a really long time so food was going cold.  finally she came when I was 3/4 of the way finished but I tried to eat slower than the slow I already eat so that I could get the green salsa that I love.  After a really long wait maybe 15 minutes and honestly I think it was more like 20 she comes back with hot enchilada sauce.  I was so upset now because the whole meal was just crap cold and soggy since we had to wait so long in between each visit.  Finally she comes back and I tell her she brought wrong sauce and that I would like the green salsa please.  Again after a really long wait she finally brings the right thing.  Anyway it was yuck and it was cold, and soggy and not fun sorry I already said that.  I used to go here all the time but the visit prior to this one almost the same thing happened.  I had a cold wet soggy burrito by the time I got my salsa.  That was in May and i used to go at least once a week.  So since that last awful visit in May 7 months later I try again and wow it was the same and worse.  Bummer, used to love this place."
0,"Although it is not a bad hotel, it definitely doesn't deliver the Vegas experience.  Not a lot of young people, more of an older crowd who just wants to gamble and chill. You can take the shuttle to the strip, but it stops pretty early. They have a TGI Fridays which is always good, bowling, theater, and other stuff. But like I said, it doesn't really feel like your in Vegas when at Sams Town."
1,"Awesome place! Clean, creative, safe, great music and environment for imaginative kids to have a blast. Our little one just turned 6 and we were visiting the area. We weren't sure if this place would be fun for kids older than say 4 or 5. She had sooo much fun! Reminded me of sweet days when I was in kindergarten. This is a great play experience:) So glad we went and at a great price!"
0,"This is not to bash anyone. To be honest I really like Vi Vi, she ALWAYS remembers me and talks to me on a personal level, and she is very patient. But no amount of niceness in the world can make that wait bearable. I went in on Friday the 21 of December, I waited 40 minutes JUST to be seated. I remember she said come early because they are usually busy in the evening, well it worked perfect because I was heading to San Diego that evening. I went in around 2:09 PM, I was greeted by her husband. (Vi was in the back) he told me it would be a 20-30 minute wait which was an obvious lie. Another person came in right after me he told her a 30-40 minute wait. Little did I know that wait time was for me. They pass up A LOT of business people won'[t wait. And I personally don't blame them. To top it off because there is a wait they aren't through at all but have no problem charging me 65 bucks for a pedicure, and full set. I don't have any problem playing for good service but this service could be a LOT better. I have been going here for about three months, and I always tip. I am not a bad customer but for the money I pay I expect a lot more. \n\nMy advice find another place? I promise you won't regret it."
0,Pros: line moves faster than the other Buffet of Buffets lines we've been in\n\nCons: the food is nothing special. We came for lunch and dinner since we stayed at PH and were disappointed both times. The food was very ordinary and doesn't live up to the Vegas Buffets expectations.

0,"DO NOT listen to any of the promoters for this club. They lie and lie and lie. Ours promised us bottle service for a certain price and then totally took it back and tried to make us pay up once he got us inside. SUPER SNEAKY LIARS!!\n\nWhen they relized we couldn't pay up they had security escort us out the back side of the club down a dark hallway and we ended up by a kitchen and by the freight elevators...it was so bizarre and then we got tagged like under 18 years old at a 21+ place with X's on our hands. All our our friends were super dressed up, we had 50/50 girls to boys ratio....it was BS."
1,"I happened to come across Kiesub while trying out the BBQ place next door. When I walked in I was like a kid in a candy store. LED's, hand tools, shrink wrap...the selection in the showroom was quite extensive. They also carried all sorts of transformers. If you've got a need for an AC transformer with specific output...check here. \n\nPricing seems to be slightly towards the higher side...for example I can get 3M electrical tape in all the colors cheaper elsewhere. But sometimes you need it, Amazon isn't fast enough and it's good to know Kiesub exists. I will be back."
1,"I really like this park,  there is really nothing else like it in the valley. It has some great water features for dogs that like to swim,  and plenty of open areas for them to run and play.   Our dog really loves the doggie play stairs (not sure what to call them,  check out my pic) and socializing with all the other dogs.  Only issue is lack of grass in the common area,  hope they plant more soon."
1,"Love this place!  Without a doubt the best pizza I have ever had and I would go again. \n\nHowever, be aware - Bring a big wallet.  3 drinks, 2 pizzas with salad = $91.00 plus tip, so bottom line was - $100.  Like I said, I will go again, but not very often."
1,"When I ask, \""What kind of milks do you have?\"" and the barista responds, \""WHAT DO YOU MEAN.\"" I immediately think a) they only have one kind of milk and b) the barista hates me/milk/life.\n\nHowever, when I replied, \""Like non-dairy milk options...\"" and she went, \""Yeah! We have 1%, whole, skim, rice, almond, soy...\"" I was temporarily perplexed, but mostly just relieved. Not only was she totally friendly, but proceeded to chat up my friend and I, sharing funny anecdotes and sarcastically grand thoughts on the restaurant business. I would even go so far as to say she was downright awesome in those five minutes.\n\nI ordered an iced almond milk latte, which was also downright awesome, and the espresso was sweet and nutty (maybe a little bit like the barista)? Either way, I'll be back for more of both. And next time, I'll just ask for the almond milk."
0,"My GF and I went to Joey's after driving by it for years, but never taking the plunge.  To say we were shocked when we stepped insided was a mucho understatement-o.  The fucker was empty.  It was a wednesday night,  and it was kinda early (6:30pm)  but I expected more than just us and the smattering of blue hairs that were seated. \n\nI don't wanna come off as an ass hat; the staff was super friendly, but this  place was downright C R E E P Y - some would say the decore inside was dated , I'd say  it felt like I was sitting in my grandma's living room.  The lights were off in half the restuarant ( that's not good) , and the A/C  was on the fritz . (or they don't believe in a/c?)   It wasn't swelteringly hot inside, but whaterver cooling system they had running could not keep my swamp ass at bay :(   \n\nLastly, the the food. While hot and ressembling standard issue italian chow, was off in a \""alternate dimension kinda\"" way.   Like a Bizzaro Pizza.  Yeah.   I  felt oogy after I ate it.   Avoid the regular ice tea, it's olive flavored. olive."
0,"This place deserves 0 stars. I'm incredibly surprised that based off the reviews nothing has been done about this establishment. I came in with my friend and stood at the front counter waiting to be seated for 10 minutes. I could understand this kind of wait if they were busy, but it was silent and all we could hear standing there was the obnoxious chiming bell in the back notifying the employees that customers came in side. Even after hearing the bell repeatedly no one came to seat us. Finally a employee comes strolling out of the bathroom and her response is \""oh, no one seated you\""? Finally she walks us to our seat and hands us menus telling us our waiter will be with us soon. So we sat for a few more minutes  and heard a few employees talking about customers behind us. Our waiter finally appears walks by our table shrugs and says \""ehh I'll get them in minute\"". We instantly decided to leave because it was apparent this restaurant didn't want our money. As we got in the car I looked in side to see 3 employees at the front counter all smiling and talking about the fact that we left. \n\nDrove a few miles down to the IHOP on power where we were seated right away and had great customer service. Our waiter here was actually professional. Even watched him help an elderly woman out side."
1,"I'm giving this location 4 stars for the fast and friendly service we received at our visit tonight. \n\nI'm not a big fan of their fries and their burger was just fair. The bread was nice and moist and the meat was tender but lacked seasoning. I loved the new touch soda machines and the location is fairly clean.\n\nIs five guys my most favorite burger spot? Unfortunately not, but the experience given by the staff bumped it up a few notches. We were sitting outside and the staff came out to give us our food and even checked on us 15 min later to see if we were still doing ok. Great customer service because they really didn't have to do any of that. My guy friend would disagree with me and say that five guys is his go to burger joint but we can all agree to disagree. What I do know is that it's definitely worth a try!"
0,"If you are looking fot Tennis classes for your kid, This is NOT a place to be. They have one basic class and put all their.\n\nAlso getting money back is really a problem. Very poor Customer Care and a very bad place for Tennis lessons.\n\nStaff is clue less and Management does not care too. I STILL have not got my money Thiefs !!"
0,"The food was not bad. We went for happy hour. I personally recommend the braised beef tacos. The service on the other hand was wretched. We sat at the bar. The bartender, \""Dolce\"" was the name on the receipt, acted as if her farts smelled like roses and hated being there. She also had the personality of a brick wall. It seemed as if she thought she doing us some giant, inconvenient favor by taking our order. She was accompanied by a bar-back who had a similiar too-cool-for-school attitude. It was astonishing how poor the service was, as the place was not even busy. Having worked in the industry, it was difficult for me to leave a poor tip. But then I thought she probably does not know what a good tip looks like. It was a pleasant surprise to go to a different joint on the Strip later in the evening and talk to bartender who had worked with her before. He confirmed that is how she always acts, and is surprised she has not been fired!"
1,"VVE is quite far from my house as i'm located on the other side of town lol. Anyways on my exploration of vape shops, one of my listed shops to visit was Vapor Emporium. I walked in and definitely liked the setup, reminded me of a cafe, seeing the tables to my right with what looked like menus laying flat. Kinda nice.\n\nI proceeded to the front counter where a lady greeted me and asked if i wanted to try some flavors. There was already a customer there, he said hi and shook my hand. I thought that was very friendly of him.  She had me take a look at all the flavors, i tried a few and thought they were pretty good.  I then asked whats their most popular and she mentioned Tidal Wave. I tested it out and immediately said \""I want this one.\"" she laughed and said \""sure!\"" \n\nAs she went to the back, the man sitting next to me and I had a nice chat. He gave me a business card and said stop by sometime. I still haven't been able to find the time sorry!!\n\nMore about the business, Tidal Wave still happens to be in my disposal as i've collected nearly 20 bottles from different vape shops around las vegas. Everytime i taste it, it tastes great and i don't think i'll ever get tired of it aha. So if you haven't tried Tidal Wave definitely try it!. VVE mixes their own juice right before you pay so it's newly made instead of sitting in a glass showcase. \n\nOverall i had a great experience here. I like the customer service, i like how the inside looks and i do like their assortment of flavors as well as their prices. Will Definitely come back when i'm in the area. A little too far for me to just go whenever i want."
0,"Bad day? I don't know. I've had better meals at other Red Lobster restaurants. The only good thing about tonight's experience was the waiter, Bryan. Fast, efficient, polite and funny, just how I like it. We had a Lobsterita (huge margarita) and shared it. Regretted it too, since it was way too sour and had a chemical taste to it. I couldn't take but two sips and then I switched to something else that I knew it'll taste much better, water. The salads were made with wilted lettuce and sore looking tomatoes. Croutons were ok. The all too familiar hot bread was good, as it is always. The main dish, a medium cooked steak and grilled shrimp was delivered on time. Steak was chewy at best, although the marinade's taste was ok. Shrimp were grilled well, not too much or too little. My wife's shrimp scampi was absolutely tasteless, overcooked shrimp in some sort of shrimp juice, with very little butter and no garlic. Pretty horrifying if you ask me.\n\nI think this is the last visit we're going to pay to this location. As I said before, I've had much better meals there and I cannot justify the bill when we are not satisfied with the quality of food. Too bad..."
1,"I told myself that on my next trip to Vegas, I was gonna try one of the nicer buffets on the Strip. My husband & I stayed at Paris, and it was a choice between Wicked Spoon and The Buffet. While I was intrigued by Wicked Spoon's mac and cheese bar, we went to the Bellagio.\n\nWe waited in line for about 45 minutes on a Monday night. It was worth the wait. The prime rib was awesome; the Kobe sirloin was even better. The cold shrimp was fresh, and the pasta had lots of flavor. Even the sea bass was good, and I never eat sea bass. I tried four of their desserts: my favorite was the tiramisu. The only thing I didn't like much was the shrimp in the paella, but that's a very minor quibble. \n\nOverall: great food, our server was really nice, even when she forgot my water, and it was definitely the best buffet we'd ever eaten at (at this point, anyway). It's definitely worth the splurge... although the Friday/Sat. prices seem a bit steep."
0,"We have not had the best experiences at Dominicks this is for sure. In fact, our 2 previous times were a complete disaster. The first time, being told we had to \""hurry up because the room was scheduled for a meeting and the 2nd time on New Years eve being told that our table needed to be cleared by pm for a private party. We said that we would never go back, but this was a friends birthday. Our friends both cardiologists met us at Dominick's for his birthday. The food is mediocre, lobster over cooked and way too much  salty seasoning!  However the ambiance is pretty, sitting by the \""pool\"" upstairs. We ate and left our table, the wait staff standing by, immediately began to clear dishes. As we walked outside, one of the doctor's recalled a cell phone was left on the table and we went back upstairs to get it, literally 5 minutes later!!!! And it was gone!. The only people standing and clearing the table were employees. And they said they had not seen it. Yeh right!!! We used the iPhone tracker on the iPad and saw that it was STILL inside the restaurant!!!!! Liars, thieves and sub-par expensive food to have a new iphone stolen? What happened to a courteous wait staff and manager (who blamed us for leaving our phone) to have repeat customers????\n\nDon't go here, go to Eddie V's (Awesome wait staff, great food), Go to Flemmings (Steaks are so much better) or go to Ruth's Chris (delicious!), is all we can say. \n\nWe will be notifying drug representatives that this establishment is NOT where they want to host their events. Never again will we go there!"
0,"This restaurant looks right out on the strip which is nice.\n\nThe waitstaff was nice but not overly efficient.  When filling our water glasses, the bus boy/assistant waiter noticed no one had brought our bread basket.  Luckily, we didn't want it.\n\nWe had the French Onion soup and three west coast oysters for appetizers.  The soup was great.  The oysters were good.\n\nWe had the duck confit and lamb as entrees, although the duck is an appetizer on the menu.  The duck is definitely a large enough portion to be an entree.  It was cooked perfectly but the confit was bland and there was not a salt shaker on the table (nor any of the others).  That's a pet peeve of mine that chefs think they have perfectly seasoned the food for every palate.\n\nThe lamb was done well, didn't see any eggplant on the plate unless it was the pear-tasting item on the plate.  There was also a very spicy pepper on the plate that was not expected.\n\nWe ordered the duck fries as a side item.  They were super bland.  We had to ask for salt and that did make them edible.\n\nWith all the choices in Vegas, I would choose to eat elsewhere."

0,"Total dump. Check in took almost an hour. Tried using self check in but it told me to see the clerk for a key so I went to the line that said \""Keys\"" and the clerk was very rude and told me I had to wait in the other huge line that took about an hour to check in including getting to our room. Room was dirty and the window only opens about an inch. We did not get any sleep because the A/C controls either went too hot or too cold and it was 95 degrees at night in Vegas this time of the year. Avoid this hotel at all cost. They attract a certain cheap type of croud that you want to avoid. We felt unsafe the entire trip."
0,"I work close by so go for occasional lunch. Lunch special price is good. The service can be hit or miss depending on your server. Food is good. But this week we were totally ignored by our waiter. My buddy complained to the manager (excuse us for being thirsty and wanting more tea) and got yelled at in return. I'm not making this up. Manager got super defensive and yelled at him. This is now the second friend of mine who has now declared to never return to this La Canasta location. Coincidentally, they are both named \""James\"". Maybe La Canasta doesn't like guys named James. This last episode may be it for me too. I'm super easy to please with service personnel, but the manager's response was ridiculous, no way to treat customers."

When ask to speak to a live person, only one I get is a sales person who is not willing to help as it's out of his experties. Also, they had promised an extra set of key for my car. It took them 2 months, to get the key for me. Pretty much, they all are good to you up until you buy the car and drive off. Once off the lot, you are nothing but an ex-client that they dont care for much. But they don't realize that it's the ex-client that gives referrals and comes back. I would not purhcase here again. Horrible after sale experience."
0,"Pretty plain. What was weird, the frosting was falling off the donut as you bite into it, now that is a reflection on the freshness... The place has great reviews and that's why I actually stopped by this hole in a wall but I know a good donut and this place does not have em"
1,"I love this concept:  healthy breakfast/brunch/lunch on-the-go.  I tried D'lish this morning for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised.  I wasn't expecting much from a drive-through establishment but they delivered a hot, yummy breakfast, coupled with a chai latte that was probably the best I've had to date!\n\nDon't go expecting the speed of fast food drive-through.  You will wait a bit but it's worth it because the food is that much better.  I tried the breakfast burrito with chicken sausage, wrapped in a warm whole wheat tortilla.  I enjoyed it.  What makes me happy is that there are several other breakfast and lunch items that look appealing to me so I know a repeat visit is in my future."
1,"Good food good service thou pricey. It's Vegas n it's inside the hotel. Expected. \nWe had the salmon rillette. Good. \nTuna tartare. Above average. Still good. \nThe bread w butter n mashed olive spread. Good. \nI wanted medium well 14 oz prime ny for my kids to share. It came out well done but still juicy so acceptable. \nHad 6 pieces of raw oysters. Not bad but not that great. May be because they were not that busy. Server said because they are usually a convention guests restaurant where there's a corporate credit card that can be charged to, in other words expensive!\nI recommend it. Not bad."
1,"Their alcohol selection sucks, as in they ran out of everything they said they had.  I had to have a Sapphire tonic...SAPPHIRE, PEOPLE!!!  \nThe waiter said she had Hendricks and then dreamcrushed my cocktail dreams.\nMy other friend wanted a beer and 8 of the beers he wanted they were \""out of\"".\nHowever, the burger was nice, very juicy and rare.  \n\nPlus, the more you drink the better everything tastes, right?"
1,"I rented 3 pieces of equipment at different times over the course of 2 days. Everyone who attended to me was energetic, polite, and super-helpful  \nFirst, they steered me to the right equipment (tile breaker and chisel.) The chisel gets sharpened after each rental. The guy at the desk and the guy in the pickup room both gave me instructions on how to use it, with their names and an invitation to call back if I had any questions. The equipment worked beautifully. \nI went back later that day to get a tile scraper (also freshly sharpened.) Same great service and attitude all around, from 2 different employees.\nTip: first timers might have some trouble finding where to park. You go behind the street-front building and angle park in front of the back building. Then you drive out through the street-front building, picking up your gear along the way."
0,"Paris Las Vegas is by the far the worst hotel one could stay in LV.  I made reservations 6 weeks ago for a Red Premier Room for a special occasion (also booked a room for my wife's parents flying in) on the site and called in to verify and everything was supposed to be set.  I didn't receive the room I reserved weeks in advance, my wife's parents didn't receive the room reserved and while escalating this at the front desk, this french speaking agent had the audacity to tell a Fortune Technology Executive that I didn't know how to use the computer and made the reservations wrong even though I had an iphone, ipad and my own wireless access point and showed her what I ordered on the website (Paris sucks even further and does not even give free Internet service to its guests unless you pay $12.95/24hours).  I should get a full refund of my T&E and immediate termination of the agent that angrily and publicly berated my technological skills.  You should never run a hotel with such piss poor customer service. Gary Loveman actually runs a place like this?"
1,"I have very tiny nails and so it can sometimes be difficult to fit acrylics to them. Not with Michelle! She skipped gluing a tip on and just sculpted them out with acrylic. They have never looked so beautiful in my life, they are so cute and dainty (but still strong). Aside from my fantastic looking nails, Michelle was a blast to chat with. \n\nI should start by saying she texted me all week trying to get me in (as a first time client) at a time that works with my busy schedule. This goes beyond what I expect from a business into downright brilliant customer service. And then within seconds of meeting her, we were having a naturally flowing conversation, which I have never experienced at a salon because most are filled with predominantly non-english speakers. She is just the loveliest person.\n\nI'm sorry, this review is so long, but I have so many great things to say about the salon. I'll list them now:\n\nMichelle is the best. The rest of the staff is also the best. Michelle is an artist with nails, not just a technician. The spa is adorable. My nails don't feel like clunky acrylics, but like dainty little extensions. The staff is committed to your satisfaction. This is my go-to salon; I will not stray."
0,"I brought 2 people here as a treat to them. When we left, our cuticles were a mess and two up us had nail polish around our nails. When I came back, the woman up front offered to redo them. I wished only for a refund (we had already been there for an hour and a half). After spending $105 there, not including the tips, I was quite annoyed to only have been refunded $30. When I requested a full refund (I am not the kind of person to complain or ask for money back, it was more about the principle of paying for poor service), the woman at the front told me I was being rude. She mentioned that they have many positive reviews on yelp and that her employees spent time  on our nails--this was totally irrelevant and yes, they spent time on our nails--we tipped them.  What kind of business owner, or manager, calls a dissatisfied client rude? very unprofessional. I am more disappointed in they way I was treated than the poor service that was provided."
1,"La Distillerie has a great atmosphere and crowd for your 20-something's who like to get their hipster drank on.  From the cool and attractive waitstaff to the unique and inspiring cocktails, La Distillerie is sure to give you and your friends plenty to talk about when you get there. \n\nThe menu has Le Freshest Design with a simple and informational style that not only explains the alcohol content level of each drink, but also the categorical flavor cohort that it can be shoved into.  From sweet and acidic to herbal, there are both classic and modern favors for you to choose from. \n\nThe only con that I had here was the time it took both to get the attention of a waiter and to finally get the drink I ordered. Other than that I loved it. Will definitely being going back to try more~~\n\nOn a side note there was one particular guy waiter who was hot-as-fux with some of the most lick-able eyebrows I have ever seen....and let's not forget about that female bartender with blonde dreads who double fisted those drink mixers and pounded that ice with that hammer like she was Thor. That definitely had me feelin some type of way."

1,"Aloha Animal Hospital is my new veterinarian for my dog. I have now been for two visits. \n\nThe docs/owners are Dr. Jamie Sulliban and Dr. Jason Sulliban. They are husband and wife and the mother of  Dr. Jason Sulliban is one of the secretaries. They treat you and your pet as if you are one of their family. \n\nThey seem to go above and beyond for their customers and their patients. I checked the mail the other day and there was a picture of my dog in the mailbox... \"" What the heck?!?!?! \"" Well it turns out it was a custom made post card with my dogs picture on it reminding me he needed his shots. I thought that was pretty cool. \n\nSo a few days later we go in for our appointment and we are greeted and my dog is given attention by everyone in there. We were put in the exam room where I see a plastic stand with a message on it. It says something like \""your dog has had a treat so here's one for you. Enjoy and the DR. will be with you soon.\"" It was a Mauna Loa chocolate covered macadamia nuts. Wow I REALLY LOVE this place now. Even I get a treat. \n\nSo the Doc comes in and he does a full exam, askes how he has been, and administers the vaccinations. Well I brought in all the vitamins and such I am giving my dog and he looked them over and answered all my questions. The two times  have been here the Doc has spent quite a significant amount of time with me. The other three animal hospitals I've have tried seem to come in and leave just as fast. This place seems to truly care and spend that extra time with the pets and the customers. \n\nTo top it all off the next day I receive a phone call and it is Aloha asking how my dog is doing and checking to make sure after all his shots and everything he is doing well. I got a check up call for my dog...I've never even gotten one of those for myself!!! \n\nI highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great animal hospital that truly cares."
0,"OMG! The previous yelper echoed my sentiments about this place precisely.  I don't know how this place stays in business.  Hydrotherapy is already an uneasy process but this owner's grim attitude makes it even more uncomfortable.  I can overlook a bad attitude here and there because everyone is allowed to have at least one bad day but this one just makes you feel bad for even coming in.  When you walk in, there's no real greeting and even though she's by the front desk, she doesn't address you for a minute.  This makes for an awkward situation. I felt like I had walked into the wrong place at first.  \n\nAnyway, I ended up going there because it was a LivingSocial coupon deal and I had wanted to try the  process.  After one session I reluctantly made a second one, and I showed up for the second one only to pick up the comfort items I purchased from the first visit. I didn't want to give this woman my money. I walked away promising myself that the next time I see a too-good-to-pass-up deal on LivingSocial or Groupon, stop and get Yelp before purchase.\n\nIt has become apparent now that some businesses can only lure new customers from using online coupon deals because they can't keep people coming back for more. \n\nMy advice to this owner is that the whole cleansing method is already an awkward situation, why not go out your way to make the client feel good about being there.\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nPS: If you read the owner's response, keep in mind that my complaint is not about my appointment time.  I still showed up in enough time to have kept it or make a new one. It's about the ATTITUDE (edited on 7/28/12)."
1,"Had lunch here with a friend.  Got the build your own burger with bacon and cheese and it was very good.  It is still just a burger but a very good burger.  Onion rings were fantastic, fries were very good.  Waitress very attentive, service a tad slow but all in all a good meal!"

Especially since MyVegas offers so many different fun comps it really makes mini vacations SUPER affordable!!!!  \n\nC you soon Mandalay !!!!!"
1,Guacamole bacon jalape\u00f1o burger with mango salsa... tickles my tongue just thinking about it. Chili cheese fries are a guilty pleasure.  Been here a few times and they always have something different on the menu.  It's very clean and the staff is fast and friendly.  Love supporting local businesses!

0,"We were just at coyote ugly and had an absolutely horrible experience. We went to the washroom and then the bouncer Martin Hampton would not let us back in. No one is an angel in vegas, but we were clearly not out of control. He claimed we  were and we are parents at almost 50 years of age with three boys. I don't know what they were up to, but they ruined our evening. When you are wrong, that is fine, but this situation baffles me. Don't you want business? and i write this note in the clearly inebriated state that they assessed me at? \n\nAVOID"

0,"Butterjoint has the space and atmosphere of a dive.  Which is great, right?  Well, in a word, no.  Butterjoint is not the dive that you love but rather the dive that you never want to go back to.  It has a reputation for making good cocktails, or so I've been told, and I can only imagine that reputation is used to mask a food menu that is uninspired in both design and execution.  I have eaten here twice, once with friends and the other time with my girlfriend.  I would not recommend this place to anyone.\n\nAmbiance: See above, I know of hole-in-the-walls just south of Washington Square Park in New York that have more ambiance in the limited curb appeal than this cramped and hot space.\n\nService: The service was fantastic the first time I went but I accredit this to the fact that my friends knew the people that worked here.  The second time, without that built-in relationship and rapport, my girlfriend and I were consistently ignored throughout the entire meal.  We were not greeted at the door.  We were not shown to a table.  It took ten minutes before anyone noticed that no server was taking our table, during which time our soon-to-be waitress gave a great big bear hug to, wait for it, someone that she knew.  No silverware was given with our meal.  The list goes on.  The bottom line is that quality of service is not measured by how you treat the regulars but how you perform on a consistent basis with any random customer.  Butterjoint would do well to learn and observe this maxim.\n\nFood: I've eaten better burgers at the chain restaurant Five Guys.  The perogies might as well have been Mrs. Ts from the freezer.  And the fries, I don't know how they tasted because they were cold and not worth even trying.  Burgers are an everyman type of food that is genuinely hard to make bad.  Butterjoint is impressive in that respect since it managed to do that very thing.\n\nPrice: Unreasonable cost for a burger that tastes like this.  I'd rather go to Five Guys to save money and have a much better burger.\n\nThe reputation for good cocktails: I can't speak on it since I ordered a beer; not a cocktail.  Given the aforementioned comments, I have to believe there are other trendy spots in Pittsburgh to quench my alcoholic thirst than this place.  \n\nIn summary, if you're hungry look elsewhere.  If you have a craving for a cocktail, I'm sure you can find a place that combines an inviting and comfortable ambiance with tasty concoctions."
1,Ordered food from my room for direct pick-up at Frank & Albert's in the hotel lobby and received excellent customer service.  Very friendly staff and excellent food.  Highly recommended.
1,"When I first brought home my new Puggle puppy, Bailey, I was so thrilled to have a dog in the house.  The store that I got her from gave me a list of various Vets in my area and said that if I took her there within a certain period of time (I think it was a week or two) for a check-up, they would cover any sort of medication or treatment she needed.\n\nFamily Vetcare was the only one on the list that was in Ahwatukee, so that is where we went.  Everyone was very nice to me and to Bailey.  There were pictures all over the place with people and their pets.  Then I started to realize that the people in the pictures were the same people working in the office . . . Very cool!\n\nAt that first visit, I found out my adorable new puppy had kennel cough and worms in her stomach.  Poor thing!  The gave us some medication (all covered by the pet store) and we were on our way. \n\nShe couldn't kick the cough, so we had to bring her back for a nebulization treatment everyday for a week (again, all covered from the store, thank goodness!).  I would drop her off in the morning on my way to work and pick her up on my way home.  Again, the staff was very friendly and seemed sincerely happy to see Bailey.  Really, she is quite cute, who wouldn't be excited to see her?!\n\nI have been here several times now and the staff has been very friendly, helpful, and caring each and every time.  I also used the boarding there once, shortly after her treatments.  I thought it would be a good idea since she new most of the staff and I didn't really have the time to shop around, being a new pet owner and all.\n\nThe boarding was fine, however, I have since learned that my little Beagle/Pug mix has a lot of energy, and does better with a fair amount activity during the day.  That is when we found Malinda's for doggy day care and boarding.\n\nStill, I am happy that the pet store pointed me in the direction of Family Vetcare.  Bailey and I have been satisfied customers for two years and counting.\n\nOh, and for anyone that thinks I am a horrible person for getting my dog from a pet store, I would just like to point out that even dogs in pet stores need a safe and loving home.  It is not their fault where they come from.  I still rescued her from that place and I would do it again."
0,"I've been going to Oregano's back when it was a tiny little dot in old town Scottsdale only sat like 6 people inside and maybe 30-50 people on the patio.  Parking was impossible and the wait was 2.5-3 hours long and loooong before they had to change the Pizookie to pizza cookie.  I have always been a fan.  Old Town, Camelback, Flagstaff, Tucson locations have always been spot on.  This location must have bad management or a bad cook or BOTH, or maybe the location just has bad mojo.  We frequented this place a few times and nothing seems to taste quite right.  Last night was the \""I have to Yelp this.\"" clincher when the take out order came  home and the pizza was so burnt and dry it was like chewing on cardboard.  The ceasar salad had the dressing on the side but they didn't even give us enough to cover the amount of lettuce.  My hands are in the air... I give up on this location.  Peace out PV Oreganos."
0,"Let me start out by saying, I was really looking forward to my spa day at the Palms. that being said I wasn't impressed.  I came in on a travelzoo deal for a facial and Swedish massage with my family. \n\nOverall Impression on the Decor/Facility:The spa looked dirty. We spotted hair everywhere we looked; in the steam room, in the jacuzzi, on the chairs. We even noticed mold growing on some of the walls/ceilings.  I was really looking forward to hanging out in the co-ed hammam  but the hammam  even had hair on the seating areas and smelled like must/funk. We asked the attendent to spray Eucalyptus oil but it still didn't cover the funk, \n\nMy Facial was probably the best part of the deal and it still wasn't anything to write home about. \n\nMy Swedish massage for lack of better words sucked. I would much rather spend 20 dollars to go get a full body foot reflexology massage where they actually apply pressure and don't talk the ENTIRE time. \n\nI hope the Palms will invest into revamping the spa. I think this spa has the potential to be with a little TLC."

0,"After doing some shopping nearby, I was lured into ATS by their slogan: \""Best Carne Asada in Phoenix\"".  When ordering at the counter, the staff seemed very disinterested in helping customers.  When I finally did order my carne asada burrito, I was given a number and asked to take a seat.  While I waited, I noticed a few other customers wondering what was going on with the bad service at the counter.  When my carne asada arrived at the table, I was starving.  However, the burrito that sat in front of me was tiny.  I'm not really one to complain about small portion sizes, as I feel that most portions are too big, but this portion was just comical.  The burrito was served with a lime wedge that was dry and looked like it had been sliced the day before.  The flavor of the carne asada was bland, as was the texture.\n\nOverall, this was a pretty disappointing meal.   \""Best Carne Asada in Phoenix\"" is a really misleading phrase to have on their sign.  This place is not even close."
0,The service was good from the server after she finally warmed up to us but the management is horrible. He was prejudice against us vs another table because of age and sports fans. Other table was an older couple upset be we wanted the sound on and were being loud when watching football in a sports bar on Sunday. Ludicrous he was never polite and nothing but irritated w us. I am someone who works in the industry and understands all needs of the patron but to be treated w such disrespect by the manager of a chain restaurant and bar is incredibly poor service.
0,I was hopeful this would be great but it was just OK.  They ran out of pulled chicken so I got the chicken breast. It was decent and the BBQ sauce was fine.  Sides are not great (fries and simple iceberg lettuce salad).  Felt hungry afterwards.  Staff were ok but it took time to get them to clean off the table.
0,I thought the food might be decent because of the very good Yelp Rating.\n\nMy husband started with the minestrone soup. The soup was very thin and watery with a burnt taste. I note this soup didn't have any beans or pasta in it but only large pieces of falling apart over cooked vegetables.\n\nWe both ordered Mediterranean Salads with Chicken. The Menu reads mixed greens but they gave us iceberg lettuce. The chicken had a nice seasoning and was a nice portion but was pounded flat and dry like chalk. The tomatoes they gave us were going bad and the artichokes were grey with old age. The roasted red peppers weren't fresh made and sweet but were full of citric acid taste. I didn't care for the dressing because it was just full of chemicals and very harsh tasting. I thought for the $12.95 price this was a very low quality salad.\n\nI noticed this place attracts a very blue collar crowd as the man seated next to me ordered two breakfast plates. I also noticed his potatoes didn't look homemade.\n\nI think the name for this restaurant might be incorrect because the sign out side reads Times Square Neighborhood Family Restaurant.\n\nMaybe they are better at Pizza?
0,"I first went to the Penguin in 2008 and it was awesome.  Hip vibe, crowded, cold beer, and delicious food.  Alas, time has not been kind to the penguin.  I have tried it several times since then when I found myself in downtown Charlotte and it has gotten progressively worse each time.\n\nThe food is still good - how can you go wrong with pimento cheese?  However, the servers are clueless, the service slow, the menu is smaller, the beer selection is limited, the kitchen is slower.  It is sad because the neighborhood has finally caught up with the coolness of what the Penguin used to be.  Do yourself a favor and try one of the many new restaurants that have opened while the Penguin was resting on its TV appearances.  Going to the Penguin will just leave you disappointed."

1,"I think that burgers are pretty disgusting.  I will never have a craving for a burger.  I'll eat a burger if I'm at a barbeque and that's the only thing to eat.  However, for some reason, I can never say \""no\"" to an In-N-Out burger.  Maybe I'm sucked into all of the hype or maybe I find it exotic since there aren't any In-N-Outs here in the Midwest.  Whatever it is, I think it's delicious!  It's such a treat whenever I'm in California or Vegas.  One time we even packed some to go before we boarded the plane; each item was separated to prevent it from becoming soggy; however it wasn't the same.  I love In-N-Out....everything's so fresh and I also love the fries!!  This place was packed because we went during lunchtime, so there was a wait, but it was well worth it!  I will definitely re-visit when I go back to Vegas!"
1,"I had heard this establishment was coming to the Trader Joe's and Changing Hand's shopping center so I was excited to see it had opened when I went to do my monthly TJ shopping this weekend and decided to give it a try.\n\nFirst, great decor and friendly staff. I sat right at the bar and was glad to see a number of local beers on tap. I ordered a Hopshock IPA and it was served on a wonderfully frosty beer glass, perfect for the summer! In addition, I went for the classic, the Margherita piiza ($9) and added the Proscuitto for $3 more.\n\nI like that you can see them backing the pizza from the dining area and it is a wood fired oven. Interesting that they add the basil fresh chopped on top versus baking it with the cheese and sauce and it did add a nice fresh, herb taste to the overall pizza.\n\nI've never been to the old location and have nothing to compare it to and for me, this establishment is a nice addition  to the overall area. I can certainly see myself going back again for lunch on a weekend and for me, extremely convenient location as it is near so many other great places in this shopping center."
0,"We have eaten here on prior visits to Casa Grande and usually enjoyed the place.  This time four of us went for dinner on a Sunday evening and were disappointed.  The first sign was when we walked in and were told that there would be a twenty minute wait when a quick glance into the dining room to the left showed at least a half dozen empty tables.  That is a clear sign of short staffing and should have been a warning.  \n\nNonetheless, we accepted bar seating at a high top, not ideal but OK, and sat for ten minutes before anyone came over to check on us.  The first thing our waiter said was it was his first day, the second was he didn't eat Mexican and didn't know what most of the dishes were.  Hmmmm.  He was also trying to be the bartender as well as a waiter and didn't do well at either task.\n\nThe food was fair, not the worst Mexican I have tasted, but mediocre at best.  the red chili in my burrito was pretty good, my shredded beef taco tasted like it was made last week.  There are too many other choices of Mexican in the area to bother with this one again."

The shopping plaza that it sits inside of might make you raise an eyebrow, but it's actually a pretty nice nice place inside and the staff is all all very friendly.\n\n They have vegetarian offerings on the menu that don't feel like a meat sandwich minus the meat (the vegetarian cheese steak is my favorite) so it's quickly become my favorite place to grab a quick bite for lunch."

The beef taco was good but nothing special.  I guess that somes up the restaurant good but nothing special.  Chips and salsa ok at best."
1,"If it weren't for Genna's I wouldn't be happily married.\nLove this bar, held my husbands 40th birthday here.\nLove the Bunnies on Easter\nHoward is the best bartender.\nGreat place to hang out for Halloween.\nReading the bathroom walls is always fun."
1,"There are two places that reside at the top of my list as must-go recommendations in the Phoenix area, and it's Cowboy Ciao and Pizzeria Bianco, but not necessarily in that order.  I'd give the Ciao 4 1/2 stars if I could, but since that's not an option and I love this place, it's getting the full 5 from me.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, to start, the magic words are \""Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry\"".  On the menu, it's stated a guest described it as being so good, they wanted to take their clothes off and roll in it.  Personally, I feel that would be rushing things.  This is a dish you need to take out to its own dinner first.  Share a bottle of wine with it.  Ask it about its dreams and its favorite books and shows.  Meet its parents, ask them permission to take things to the next level, and when the time is right, then you can get naked and commence aforementioned slather rolling.\n\nOf course this only goes for mushroom lovers.  For those anti-mushroom-ites out there, I don't understand you, but turn your heads for a sec and hum the theme to Mario Bros while I whisper the ingredients to those with an affinity for Earth's favorite fungal treat:\n\n(Cremini, button, oyster, cepe, lobster, black trumpet, shiitake, morel, and yellow foot mushrooms in ancho cream over double-cooked polenta, topped with grilled portabellini, avocado, tomato and cotija cheese)\n\nI know, right?  And yes it tastes as good as it sounds.  \n\nFor the mushroom challenged, you can look back now.  Another dish I highly recommend is their \""Stuffed Pork Rib Chop\"" which is gorged with Shropshire blue cheese then grill-seared and oven-finished and served with ancho bread pudding, apple jus, raisin/fig compote and pan-grilled vegetables.  Holy hell this is good.  This is the kind of dish you cheat on the Mushroom dish with, let's call it your Meat Mistress.  This dish says to hell with rolling around naked, and suggests going straight to a threesome.  Any of the dishes on the menu will fit the bill for this taste romp, as would the many creative drinks they have to offer.  Just do what it says and remember to set your safe word.\n\nFor dessert, skip the bacon cookies.  It's interesting and all, but really not worth it.  Instead go with the blue cheese cheesecake or the bread pudding.\n\nI've been here half a dozen times and loved it each time.  There are still many more dishes I'd love to try, including the hearty salads I never got around to.  I just hope their Testosterone Salad is named for being manly in its steak and bourbon soaked roots, and not due to containing millions of little swimming chromosomes.  Forget I said that... \n\nOh hey try not to get lost in the wine list!  It's a labyrinth best left to the Goblin King.  But even 1986 David Bowie might not find his way out of this one.  Don't say I didn't warn you.  Just go with one of the dozen or so wine flights available unless you know exactly what you want.  The wine list has no real power over you as long as you don't show visible fear.  It can smell fear."
1,"Everything was delicious!\n\nI would've given them 5 stars but the waitress came back twice to tell us that they've ran out of what we ordered.  We ended up getting full on bread and getting our food 1 1/2 hours after we ordered.  However, the taste of the food and the prices made up for the wait.\n\nYum."
1,"I was apprehensive about coming here for a Naked and Famous show just because of all the horrible reviews I read on here about it. In all honesty, I think the venue was actually pretty great. We arrived early so we had no issues getting our will call tickets or finding parking ($7). The stage/standing area was clean and well-maintained. Since I arrived early, I was able to stand near the front and be very close to the band. It's an intimate setting and I think as far as a venue for a concert goes, this place exceeded my expectations."
1,"I actually found this guy on Yelp.  I purchased some sandals last fall on sale, and unfortunately, I needed some extra holes punched in to them because they were hurting my feet.  I had tried to exchange them at the store, but because it had been so long, I was unable to do so.  I was encouraged by the store to find a local shoe store to just get holes punched into the straps to accomidate my situatation.\n\nSo, I find this guy on Yelp.  I called in advance to see if he would be able to help me.  He said he could, and that he was open until 3.  So, I race over there, and he punched the holes in my sandals while I waited!  wooohoo! I was so grateful!\n\nHe charged me 50 cents a whole, times 4 holes for a whole $2!  This is great! \n\nThe store itself is small, but organized and rather clean.  They sell all kinds of shoe stuff, and do all kinds of repairs not only just to shoes, but luggage, zippers, etc.  He says he's been in business for 16 years now, and to keep coming back.  Good experience for something so simple and mondane."
1,I love this place! Prime rib sandwich is SO good. It's a little pricey but I think it's worth it :) Great lunch spot while at work.
0,"My friend and I just got done with some shopping and decided to stop by for some boba on our way home. We both got the red bean boba slush.. which was amazing. \n\nHowever, the staff was just horrible. They were very unprofessional and rude. They seemed too busy talking about their personal lives rather than do what they're being paid for. We heard them talking while waiting for our drinks, with a few sprinkling of curse words here and there. I understand that sometimes people bring their personal agendas to their workplace, but it is never okay to discuss it in front of customers, especially when you're speaking inappropriately. They had no regards for their customers. They spoke like they didn't care how they are representing the company.\n\nThere were about four girls working but it took about 10 minutes for us to get our drinks. I've had a much shorter wait time at other boba places with only two, or even one, worker. I don't understand how it took that long to make our drinks with that many workers on the clock.\n\nAnd another thing.. when our boba was finally ready, we heard one of the girls yell, \""Okay fuck this, I'm getting off!\"" \nO_O Uhm really..? \n\nI think this place would be great if they hired more responsible workers who can actually represent the business in a professional manner. They seemed like they were just hanging out somewhere gossiping."
0,"This place is beyond not good. I see all of the 5 star reviews but how many friends and relatives can you have. We went in at 7:30 on Sunday and they were out of the beer we ordered. There were a total of maybe ten people in the place. The waitress was new so it took a while to sort that out. OK no biggie, we ordered alternatives. Then we ordered three different tacos. About thirty minutes later our waitress comes to check on how our food is, the problem is we have no food. So we are into this ordeal over an hour and are making zero progress. We paid for our beers and left."
0,"We've been there three times, trying to square its stellar reputation with our experience;  last night was for supper.  \n\nSERVICE: It took an hour for the food to arrive;  we'd ordered easy appetizers, a burger and a baked chicken dish.  Trop Tarde!\n\nSTAFF: We've found them to be engaging, but distracted.  The restaurant doesn't deign to put out salt and pepper shakers; I asked two waiters in succession to get those for me.  Nothing happened after about 10 minutes, so I got up and went for them myself;  lots of confusion and hand-waving to get them, only to find they were not functional.  Merde!\n\nAMBIENCE:  Nice;  the lake, the swans, plausible pseudo-French accents, a neat guy handling the music.  C'est bon!\n\nFOOD:  The broiled shrimp, cheese grits & remoulade appetizer was execrable.  I'm from New Orleans;  we board up and condemn restaurants that massacre simple dishes like that.  My wife liked the burger, but it didn't like her;  it entertained her for 24 hours ;-(  My broiled chicken was meh exemplified.  Any Albertson's rotisserie can beat it;  \u00e9crasez l'inf\u00e2me!\n\nPRICE PERFORMANCE:  All this mediocrity for a tipped bill of ~$83?\nScandale!\n\nOVERALL:  Alright, kindergarten's over.  No more March\u00e9 for me.\nC'est Fini!"
1,"What? 3 stars only? This place is gold!!!!\n\nI stumbled upon this place years ago, when I lived around the corner. And fell in love! Sure, it's small and can be cramped on the weekend--- but that makes it cozy! The decorations are quaint and cute, making it feel like a dining room from a B&B rather than a restaurant smack in the middle of a strip mall.\n\nThe servers here are nothing but friendly. It's a small, local place, so everyone knows each other. I went so many times that each server started to recognize me.  \n\nBut what really clinches this place is the food. Heavenly breakfasts, my favorite meal, Every time, I order the maple french toast--- soo good! Add to that a maple muffin, and it's sweet carb heaven. They used to serve great sausages here, too, but changed the menu. Disappointing, but wouldn't keep me away!\n\nI recently moved to L.A., and have yet to find a replacement for Maple Tree. It sucks, because it was our tradition to go here every weekend. I can't wait to go back, next time I'm in town!"
1,"I had never heard of a third party licensing option, so I was kind of leery when my friend recommended Power Tags, Titles & More. However, the DMV sucks, and this place is right by my house, so I gave it a whirl - and I'm glad I did!\n\nStaff is friendly, prices are fair (a few bucks more than the DMV).\n\nMy vehicle was completely licensed in less than 30 minutes. The process was insanely simple, and I would recommend this place to everyone!\n\nThey don't do drivers licenses as of April 2014 but they said perhaps in the fall."
0,"It's like Buffalo Wild Wings minus the wings. Well, yeah, and more beer. Barely.\n \n At 4pm on a Thursday three friends and I found an empty table (shocking in a place that likely seats fewer people than The Grind). \n After roughly ten minutes at the table one of my friends finally got up and asked a waitress for menus. As there were probably 25 people working, it wasn't hard to find somebody to ask. Strange since not one of them had been over to us yet.\n She wasn't given a bottle list, which apparently is a claim to fame for them, but we got to look over their taps and a list of local eateries that are willing to deliver.  Hmm, no thanks on that idea.\n The taps were a disappointment. A large variety of over priced local offerings, some mediocre imports (Colorado and Oregon make great beer but having Dead Guy on your tap isn't risque). Not even a single sour. \n At this point we were getting pretty thirsty. A timer was set for 15 minutes. If a server didn't ask us for an order we were outta here.\n The server did finally show up. She talked to the other party taking up the rest of the room. I leaned into my group and told them that watch, this girl wasn't going to even *allow* us to make eye contact. She was going to get their bill straight, ignore us, and split. \n Exactly what happened. She literally kept her back to us the *entire* time she was in the room. \n \n On the way out I asked a server if the room we were sitting in offered wait service, or if the customers were expected to walk to the bar to order a beer. Again, without eye contact, she said yeah the room has service, and then turned her back to me and stared at her notepad. \n\n This isn't their first location. A company with as many outlets as these guys have should open with servers who know how to carry one-single-product from point A to point B. \n Rude servers. Maybe not all of them, but I wouldn't know. After the three I dealt with here I won't ever deal with a fourth.\n Lackluster tap list. If you want good taps go to Taste of Tops or Brat House, or a smaller spot like TMI. \n No food. Having deliveries doesn't count. \n Big Business Chain. While the owners want you to think its an edgy, tattoo'd and hip local spot for cool kids, it's not."
1,I have been here several times now and have never had bad service.  One time my son and I went to watch UFC the bar was packed so they put us in a separate room with a TV to the fights.  The Sleepy Dog is my favorite draft and the smoked wings are AWESOME.
0,"$85 for 12/28/08 night, we had 2 rooms. First thing I noticed in MGM Grand was that there's no one organizing the crowds for check-in/out, everyone just had to find a lucky line to get in, like the supermarket style. Our check-in process was smooth except that we found out our rooms were hundreds of numbers apart, so we went back in line to ask for a closer distance, and the CSR replaced another room right next to each other - so why didn't he just do that the first place? Obviously that room wasn't taken. Than we bumped into a huge disappointment after we entered our rooms - bulky TV, no fridge, no blow dryer. Later I found out that my sink (not sure about the other room's) couldn't drain properly, I had pause washing my face so the water wouldn't over float... Pillows weren't comfortable either. The next morning we were waiting for elevators for over 15min (not kidding) with other 20+ ppl on the 10th floor and noticed that only 2 out of 6 elevators would open, but both were full every time they opened. Finally a janitor offered us staff elevators so we could leave but the security guard just had to ruin it. He let us in, but had to tell us how the janitors weren't supposed to offer us staff elevators because we weren't staff. We complained to the CSR when we checked out and they only wanted the security's name, but our concern was the 4 broken elevators that wouldn't open, and wanted them to deliver the msg to every staff, including securities, that guests are being trapped so pls open the staff elevators. I stayed in Tuscany twice and their rooms were big, fully equipped and new. Palms had the same price but I wrongly chose MGM Grand - bad bad choice."
0,"It saddens me that I have to write this review because I had such high hopes for Always Unleashed. Their method for allowing the dogs to interact with each other and their pre-screening process for evaluating new dogs led me to believe that they truly cared about the quality of the stay that dogs had there; unfortunately I have found that is not the case. They do not dedicate the necessary staffing resources or have the proper controls in place in ensure that dogs have a healthy and happy stay at their establishment. Obvious signs of sickness go overlooked without apology and their is a seeming disregard for the trust that owners place with them to keep their dogs healthy. When I picked my dog up from Always Unleashed after a weekend stay I was immediately shocked at how malnourished he appeared and how lethargic he was acting, they simply stated that dogs play hard when they are there and that his behaviour was normal. When we got home it became even more obvious that my dog was very sick and probably had been for the duration of his stay there. He was vomiting and had horrible diarrhea, he wouldn't drink any water and when I weighed him I was shocked for find that in a matter of 3 days he had lost 10 pounds. Immediately (after measuring his weight loss), I took my dog to the veterinarian, on the way I called to ask if they had noticed anything out of the ordinary with his behaviour - I was told that he was very active the entire time, that he has eaten all of his meals, and that he didn't have any vomiting or diarrhea. When I pressed to find out specifics about his meals (which I was suspicious of because nearly half of the food that I sent with him was returned to me) I was again told that he had eaten his meals, when I explained that was impossible because he still had almost half of his food leftover and it was measured out exactly I was given excuses like \""sometimes it is hard to watch all of the dogs\"" and \""sometimes we miss lunches because we are only used to feeding twice a day\"" even though previously I had been assured that he had eaten every meal completely and that it had been specifically documented as such. When I asked again to have the owner check specifically with people that had interacted with Biscuit if he had signs of sickness like diarrhea and vomitting and when that may have begun I was told \""well, it is really hard to tell because sometimes a dog may vomit and another dog will just eat it, so we won't notice\"" and that there are too many dogs to be observant of each dogs bowel movements, and \""I told them to watch for that type of thing, but it was about six months ago so I don't know if they are still implementing it\"". At every question that I posed the owner was defensive without taking any responsibility, always looking for some way to demonstrate that it was not her or her establishments fault, I was never offered so much as an insincere apology. After tests the vet informed me that my dog was severely dehydrated, and that he had a foreign body in his intestinal tract, after confirming with an ultrasound that he had a bowel obstruction they took him to surgery to remove it. I am grateful to say that he is home with us now recovering. I do not blame Always Unleashed for whatever it was that my dog ate to obstruct his bowel (even though with appropriate supervision that could have been potentially avoided as well), but I do believe that my dogs symptoms should have been noticed much earlier so that he could have been treated sooner and gone through much less suffering. Also, I was blatantly lied to with regards to him getting the food we prescribed, and the story regarding his behaviour there changed from entirely positive that he was healthy the whole time to unsure at all of how he acted or even ate. If you are lucky enough that your dog doesn't run into any trouble while you are gone, then he probably would have a great time at always unleashed, but if you are unfortunate enough that your dog needs some extra help or care, they do not have the resources, know-how, or respect for the love of your dog, to take the necessary steps to take care of him properly. Any dog owner concerned with the health of their dog while they are away, should avoid this place at all costs."
1,$25 for a basic pedicure. Was given a small bottled water right away. Their foot massage was really really nice.  He was delicate with my cuticles. Clean and careful.  The curtains between massage chairs make it more comfortable. Had a nice time with my girlfriend here.  Would come back.
1,Two Words: Sushi Bar\n\nYes they have a sushi bar inside and yeah it is pretty decent!
0,"I was surprised that there was no line and on entering there were very few diners. It soon became apparent why; there were only a few dishes offering anything close to eye appeal.  I don't mind sacrificing a little quality for variety, but this buffet included canned corn and peas/carrots.  I stopped whining long enough to eat a salad with bottled blue cheese dressing, overdone mahi mahi, one bite out of a dried out BBQ pork rib,2 slices of overdone pork loin, a chocolate covered strawberry and a tasteless Napoleon."
1,Great massages!
0,"Tao is incredibly overstuffed with pompous people. The main dance floor is far too busy to enjoy yourself. You begin sifting through bodies of people and realize that it's not worth it the effort.\n\nI've been to other nightclubs on the Strip and I was looking forward to this place considering the hype. I was left with a boring experience.  Big frills, few thrills."
1,"A friend of mine knew some of the family who own this place, so we decided to go check it out for lunch. My friend is vegan, and I eat meat, so it was great that they could accommodate both of us! \n\nSince it was a nice day in Pittsburgh, we decided to order some \""mixers\"" even though we didn't bring any alcohol. I ended up getting the lemon/basil and it was basically basil infused lemonade (nomz). This is seriously something I've been dreaming of for a long time- yummy refreshing drinks for summer. They hit it perfectly! My friend got the strawberry with mint and it also tasted great. \n \nI had the prosciutto sandwich which came with st andre cheese on it and was DELICIOUS.  The bread was terrific and the flavors together were salty and tasty, perfect to my liking.  My dining partner got a veggie burger and was very pleased with it as well.\n\nFor dessert I had some sort of chocolate mousse that seemed to have a caramel-like sauce on top with a pinch of salt which made it divine! \n\nSuper impressed with the food here and I can't wait to go back for more! Well worth the drive to Bellevue from the city. \n\nYay!"
1,"Ok i walked in to this place while i was out there for a business trip and was in need of a cut bad i'm usually really picky about who cuts my hair (because its really thick and curly and can look really bad if cut wrong) but i had a big meeting at a casino and needed to look my best. So this women named Kat came up and asked me what i needed and how i liked my hair cut i gave her a general overview of what i liked and asked her to cut it how she would like it, well needless to say when she was done it looked great. There are people who learn to cut hair and then there are people who have natural talent to cut hair and kat was born to style hair thank you, you did an amazing job. I'll be see you for another trim next time im in town."
0,"Love the food and the happy hour where you can experiment and try several dishes, sort of a Spanish tapa restaurant. Chicken lettuce wraps are always a winner!\n\nGreat decor, cozy, reasonable prices ... BUT a consistently uncaring, careless almost arrogant service all three times I've been here. And the wait staff isn't young and inexperience so I'm at a loss why they can't be more customer-service oriented.\n\nShucks. Love the food, so maybe take-out is the way to go or just avoid this location."
1,Best Pizza I have had in Nevada.
1,"Nice staff and ambiance, lots of variety in terms of food options, delicious food.\n\nA bit awkward to have the buffet upstairs, especially if you sit down stairs. Carrying a tray down narrow stairs, made me nervous.\n\nThe food is way too expensive, to my liking. I love the food but can only afford to splurge like that once a year, especially on a buffet. Im used to more affordable buffets."
0,"Odd, actually. One server and one bus person running like mad. Three servers standing in the back talking the entire time. Thought strange enough to clock the time from ordering a draft beer and 10 minutes later reminding them to please bring the draft beer. Burgers were good, not great. Never did get a water refill. Won't be going back. Too many other good places to eat nearby. Disappointing and slow slow slow."
1,"got a great deal online. $20 a night for one room and free steak dinner for two (no purchase necessary, not like other offer that buy one get one free) plus other free slot and table match play. It's like staying for free! \nso no complaints from me.\nroom size is decent and clean , parking is easy, and $3 black jack table for a small time gambler like me is perfect!\nwant to come back here every weekend for this deal!"
1,"This place isn't cheap, but the fish is top-notch and worth the money.  The food is cooked to order.  Their fillets (I had the catfish) have good size and are absolutely delicious.  I will definitely return to try their other fish and seafood."
1,"Raucous, loud, rock-n-roll watering hole: fuck yeah!\n\nMy exact recollection of my experience here is somewhat hazy; mostly all I can remember is having a blast.  I wound up at Hogs & Heifers with a fairly big group doing a downtown pub crawl.  It was kind of a relief to find a dark, dingy cave of a bar after all the lights and 'showiness' of the casinos.  \n\nThe place wasn't too crowded when we arrived, and there was some kick-ass music blasting out of a robust sound system.  I'm not usually one for dancing (in public, anyway)... well, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, right? :)"
1,"Sure it's walking distance from my house - so I was hoping I would have a new place for my morning tea.   After finally re-opening after the fire on 16th and Bethany Home, I was excited to check out Luci's.\n\nThe design of the the place is fantastic simple, sexy, a little modern and throw in some retro corner grocery feel.  I was greeted with fun, friendly service, and then left with a great pastry and a tasty ice tea for the road.  \n\nThey seem to still be working out some kinks since the re-open, but I see it only getting better.  In fact I just got myself excited.  I think I am going to head over there now for my morning snack."
0,"This is the worst little Caesars I've been to. Now I already have really low expectations as it is hot n ready, but every time I get it the pizza tastes like cardboard! Like it's been in a fridge for a week. Since I live close to here I've found that bad pizza is consistent and it was never a fluke. I even tried box just ordering it fresh and waiting around 7 minutes for it and it still came out awful. The crust was too chewy and overcooked, the sauce/ toppings were skimpy (there was a full one and a half inch ring of crust around it), and the cheese was burnt. You'd expect they could at least make good fresh pizza. I'd skip this little Caesars and head to the Pizza Hut across the street or the little Caesars on Val vista and university"
0,"So, most of my reviews are going to be based on the quality and taste of the food.  I don't find that I experience really bad service or great service that often, most is satisfactory.  \nOn with the review.  The bread that they bring at the begining was pretty delicious, but sad when that was the best part of the meal.  Most of us had pasta, mine was extremely bland (I had the creamy garlic chicken)  I had to add a lot of salt and I never salt anything.  My fiance had the fresh tomato mozzarella pasta and it was terribly bland also, the tomatoes hardly even had taste.  The only thing in our group of six that seemed to be good was the chopped gorganzola salad. \nI would much rather support a local restaurant than a chain, but I would have to say that I would rather eat at Olive Garden than here."
0,"Ok I swear I tried to like this place first it took 25 min to get my three tacos and nachos then my nachos where soggy. The carne was dry and not flavorful, I then tried the fish Taco it tasted like cat food. I didn't eat a forth of my meal I lost my appetite."
0,Not this location specifically but the bank itself is crap. \n\nToday was supposed to be my billing date on my credit card. Went into a branch and they asked if I wanted to take all my money out of my checking account. Honestly how dumb can you get? Then the servers just happened to crash. I was told to call the number on the back of my card. I did just that. A few times. \n\nThe first guy did the same thing as when I was in the branch itself. Thought I wanted to take money out of my checking account. Seriously? Okay. Nope. Screw you too. I said I wanted them to take money from my checking account to pay my credit card bill. But that it was whatever now and hung up. I'm not wasting my time dealing with you and your crap when I have more important things to do. \n\nI call again and this guy tells me that to pay the bill over the phone there is a service fee. First thing I did was hang up. \n\nSeriously? A service fee to pay my freaking bill. That I've been trying to take care of for the last hour? Okay that makes no sense. \n\nSo now that I have discovered how truly horribly they are able to take care of their customers I'm really really planning on getting rid of any and all service I will ever have there. \n\nWhat is the point in trying to do what you need to when all they do I say is you have to pay this much more for us to do what you need to be done. Or that the only way we can help you is by making you jump through 200 different hoops. Nope. Screw all of you. I'm done.
1,"Layers, O let me recount the times.....back when I lived in Las Vegas, they shared the same strip mall space next to TJ's and Layers was a weekend ritual for me. A jewel in the sea of strip malls and Starbucks. While not a great place for coffee (seriously, Las Vegas was always lacking in this department!), the desserts were good - from flourless orange almond spice cakes/tortes to rich chocolate decadence (check out their small molten chocolate ganache cakes...mmmmmm). And....i'm not a dessert person, so kudos to the bakery! BTW, on Saturdays, they always had something special on the menu - like applewood cheddar bacon scones. \n\nAnyways, I'm glad to hear that they're moving to a new location. One serious complaint was the lack of space - and now it seems like they're keen on correcting that. I can't wait to try them out again at their new location!"
1,"Over the past couple of years, I have been in here a few times for gifts. A few things I like about Little Luxuries: free giftwrapping, nice selection of colorful stainless steel water bottles, excellent cards, and cute sunglasses for $10."
1,Love Arby's. However a medium curly fries is allegedly 600(!) calories. So worth it though. 1 star off for their shakes being mediocre. They always seem to be pretty thin.
0,"Waited 25 min after being told 5-10. Then tried to seat us in the bar at a high top but I can't sit in them because I have a leg that doesn't bend. The entire time we waited there was an open booth in the bar area that we were told we couldn't sit at. Then a group that came in after us was offered the booth. But they took a night top, so I asked again about the booth. Still no. Even the manager didn't help. Her response was \""I can't just jump in and tell her how to seat people\"" never coming to this applebees again!"
0,"They ruined our neighborhood Pei Wei.  We used to do PW once-a-week.  Loved the food and everything else about the place.  Unique flavors that we couldn't find anywhere else.  We finally went last night after the new \""Market\""  opened.  I like the idea of the smaller portions. I can even deal with the new limited menu... But what used to be fresh food, wok-seared and served extremely hot is now pre-made and warmed up then plopped into a plastic dish.  Then you get to find your own plastic utensil to eat with.  The people that used to work there that we saw on a regular basis are now different employees, and with no customer service (bordering on rude).  The new seating is uncomfortable, and the ambiance is non existent.  We will never go back.  For 30 cents more, and a drive over to 44th & Thomas, we can get twice as much food, that is served well (and HOT)  by people who act like they care if we are happy eating there.  \n\nI understand this is a pilot restaurant to compete with the fast food joints.  If I want that, I will go to Panda Express.  Pei Wei, you are making a HUGE mistake.  Bad move!"
0,Went with 4 friends.  After we were done we bet how long this place would be open?   All our food came at once.  So the appetizer and our soup got pushed aside. The staff was very dumb and didn't care how long empty plates and bowls stacked up.  I give the food 4 out of 10....  Go home hungry or just hit Millers or the Yardhouse!!!!
1,"My significant other wanted me to go to a Cirque du Soleil show.  The Cirque shows at the MGM and other places were $80+ for terrible seats.  I suggested Zumanity because the tickets were a lot cheaper and the venue was a lot smaller.  The front desk at our hotel (MGM) gave us a free booklet with a list of shows and things to see in Vegas.  There was a coupon inside for Zumanity buy one ticket get another for $10.  We ended up getting tickets for the third row at the box office in New York, New York. \n\nWe knew it was an \""adult\"" show, but I didn't know what to expect besides some frontal nudity.  It is definitely not a show to take your parents to see (although I did see a mom and adult son).  There are a number of sexual and topless aspects of the show.  The MC is a drag queen and he was great and hilarious.  The show has great humor, jokes, audience interaction, and there is something for most sexual preferences and desires.  There are some gay and lesbian aspects - this may be off putting to some people - my view is what ever floats your boat.  Even if the main scene was not your thing (gay, midgets, cross dressers), there were usually people in the background doing something.  So even if the concept of a three way with one girl and two guys is not interesting to you... you can check out the topless girl dancing in the background.\n\nThere are some acrobats in the show, but the main focus is on sexual themes.  The crowd was a great mix of people: old, young, hetero, homo, foreign, and interracial couples.  Minor comment: the female performers are (mostly) in great shape so they are a little low on the cup size."
1,"Absolutely LOVE Nail Haven!  My girlfriend and I visit monthly for our pedicures.  They have an awesome membership plan for $15 a month and you get a free pedicure, plus 10% off any other services.  They are the BEST pedicures with hot rocks and everything.  They take their time as well.  I don't know about you, but when I'm getting a pedicure, I want to relax, and I love that they don't rush you through it.  I really don't understand why there is such a negative review on here, but I guess everyone has different experiences.  The staff is great and they all know us when we come in, even if it's been a month.  It's very nice and clean inside and doesn't smell as strongly of nail chemicals as most places.  Love this place!"
1,"I went here last night with a party of 7 for dinner.  The place was pretty dead for being around dinner time which was odd yet nice.  The weather was perfect so we sat outside.\n\nI wouldn't mistake this place for a tavern, but I guess it is as close as you can get in the Scottsdale Quarter.  The vibe and decor of the place is pretty cool and I guess it kinda looks like an \""urban\"" tavern.  However their beer selection is pretty weak for a tavern.  The have about 2 dozen or pretty standard brews.\n\nThe food:\n\n* hummus = ok\n* mac n cheese = ok\n* pretzel = excellent.  I really really liked the mustard that came with as well.\n* grilled salmon = pretty good but also pretty standard\n* steak salad thing = This is more steak than salad but it was very good.  The steak strips were cooked perfectly and made a great addition to the salad.  The salad itself was very good and had a very flavorful and complementary dressing.\n* French Fries = excellent!!  Freshly made and perfectly cooked.  LOVE the salt.  HATED the homemade ketchup - it was like marinara sauce mixed with BBQ sauce.  No bueno.\n\nI was expecting crappy service because of what the reviews said on here, but it was actually quite good.  The place was pretty dead so the staff would be hard pressed to NOT be attentive.\n\nAll-in-all it was a pretty good meal and dining experience.  I wouldn't rush back because it isn't really that special of a place, BUT if the other places in the Quarter are too jam-packed; I would return."
1,"Another perfect dive bar in Polish Hill. I would put their drink and food specials up against any other bar in Pittsburgh. This is the definition of a blue collar, slightly punky dive bar. The food is greasy, the people are grungy, and the beer is mostly the cheap stuff that you drink without complaint. And who can say no to a happy hour with a burger, fries, and a Yuengling for under 5 bucks?? That's right: no one. Front and back room that's dark, (really) smokey, and a stage in the back for live music (the scene is ok). I stop by every couple of weeks after work with my boss, and I recommend anyone else to do the same- and make sure to come for happy hour. Here's to seeing you there sometime!"
1,"Perhaps on your excursion to Scratch, you had a triple chocolate stomach ache or some sort of fruit tart mouthgasm in mind, which totally makes sense. It's basically the closest thing to a (euro-hipster) patisserie in town.\n\nI, however, wanted a salmon burger. Hear me out: 'twas fantastic. The patty itself was incredibly tender and m-word (say \""voiced\"" but replace \""v\"" with \""m\""... god, I hate that word) and paired flawlessly with the coriander sauce and coconut cream that accompanied it. I'd definitely rank it in my top 10 anything-but-ham-burger list. \n\nBut, the surprising aspects of Scratch don't stop there. They offer a completely vegan cheese burger topped with mushrooms, cucumbers, avocado, peppers and tahini, as well as vegan soups and salads. A butter-and-eggs bakery, doling out vegan entrees? Oh no they didn't (but actually they did) and you can color me impressed. Now, if only my sorry excuse for a wallet could handle the admiration I have for your food...\n\nI didn't buy from the pastry window, but I inquired about nutritional information, to which they replied, \""We don't have it listed... probably because it's really bad for you, honestly (chuckle.)\"" And you know what? That's the best damn answer I've ever gotten from a dessert counter. Thank you for your salmon patties, your vegan food, and your honesty, Scratch."
0,"We were happy to find a veg place nearby our AirBnB accommodations, but were a bit disappointed with our meal. \n\nWe ordered the \""albalone\"" appetizer, \""beef fun\"" dish, and \""beef\"" sandwich.  The first thing I noticed was that all the vegan versions of the dishes were priced higher ($.50-$1) than the vegetarian versions (they all list both prices).  Since typically for a vegan meal you are taking away an animal product (eg, egg) this doesn't seem fair, but maybe there is something else making it more expensive I'm not aware of. \n\nOn to the food - in summary, the flavors were uneremarkable, and in the end (about one hour afterward) we were hungry again and our stomachs were a little upset. \n\nThe abalone was just like a thick noodle/starch with no flavor (the sauce was very good).  The beef fun dish was good, but greasy and unfilling - it seemed like sprouts were the go-to filler. The sandwich was plain with the same \""beef\"" and many shredded carrots on a soft bun. \n\nFrom other reviews it appears we should have ordered different dishes, which would warrant the higher ratings reflected. So perhaps we just chose the wrong options. If I were in town longer I might return to try the crispy chicken or crispy pork rolls.  It's great that LV has this much-needed option in town for veg food - since it appears to be a well-loved establishment.  \n\nThe atmosphere reminded me of places in Chinatown in Seattle ... minimal ... which is fine if the food is good.. The service was just fine, nice people.\n\nNote that it's cash only, which necessitated a quick trip to the ATM!"
0,"Only once. Never again. Although the food tasted great, I waited 45 min after my entire family finished their meals. The waitress even took their plates before I ate. When my dish finally arrived it took all of 10 seconds to finish. Smallest most expensive dinner I have ever had."
0,"Sadly I'm giving them a 1 star because I sat there for 10 minutes (while writing this review) before walking out! I realize it was later in the afternoon but to be completely ignored for that long (when the restaurant isn't even busy) is ridiculous! \n\nI love this place back home in CO so when I saw that we had one in PHX I was ecstatic! \n\nI hope they don't treat all their \""lunch\"" hour guests that way!!!"
0,"Worst service ever since they changed to electronic ordering!! I was 5 minutes away and wanted to place an order to go over the phone so I called in, much to my surprise they have a new phone ordering system where I was directed to some call-center who knows where. I was then told I would need a credit card to place an order, understandable if I was ordering lunch from my office or at home but in this case I was in the car driving so I do not have access to my credit card. I was told I would have to place the order in the store, as I arrived there were 20 people in line some trying to figure out how to use the electronic ordering system. I figured it would be easy so I tried, swiped my credit card, and I was told I placed the order incorrectly and was told I would have to place it again. not only was I in a rush at that point I would have to speak to a manager to get the credit from the first order that I placed incorrectly. Then someone tried to explain it to me, i didn't want a lesson, i wanted her to correctly take my order. So they're \""efficient \""electronic ordering system has delayed me getting to work By 30 minutes, I left with the incorrect order so that I did not have to place another order and wait to be refunded. What a headache and what poor customer service. They offered me a complimentary drink for my hassle, I just laughed and left. What I really wanted was my correct order, and the computer/iPad isn't going to do it. Save yourself some time in the morning and stick with good old fashion Starbucks or local places like Rocky River Coffee, where they know that customer service is done face to face and will make a true effort in making your order right."
1,"Stopped by during CES.  Banger Brewing is a great addition to downtown.  Great Beer and a super friendly staff.  Loved the 5 beer sampler with locally made flavored popcorn.  I think the IPA was my favorite but all the beer was good or unique.  Anyone visiting Vegas who wants to get away from the Strip and experience something more genuine, head down to Banger Brewing and get the sampler.  They don't serve food but another cool new downtown addition called the Container Park has some good choices and its only a block away.  I'll be back next year."
1,"Good food, great bar atmosphere with lots of TVs! Beer specials could be better, but certainly not the worst. Outside patio is an amazing space to watch the games."
0,"Warning for anyone in a wheelchair who wants to eat here.......... \n\nI didn't get a chance to eat here because they ran out of the normal, lower dining tables and only had seating at the bar or one of those high top / bar tables. This is NOT good for a person in a wheelchair like myself. I was informed by a hostess that a month ago management decided to remove 1/2 of the dining tables and replace them with the high tops... thus becoming way less wheelchair friendly. I don't want to eat when I can't see my food because the plate would be at eye level or worse depending on the height of one's wheelchair. This is just WRONG. \n\nFor just drinking purposes, I suppose it would do. \nBut , I definitely think they need to do something about this little bit of discrimination and use a little common sense. How can I eat from a high top table when I can barely see what I would be eating? I'd get more ON me than IN me.\n\nI was really looking forward to eating at this place too.\n\nEdited to add : I'm not sure why people are finding this issue FUNNY."
1,"Screaming Orgasm Sauce...whatever dude.  Lame name and nothing special at all.\n\nI've spent quite a bit of time at Mandalay Bay and have eaten here on 3 separate occasions.  Every time has been a wonderful experience.  \n\nService is on top of their game.  There are tons of them hovering around...the most I have ever seen in a restaurant.  My water was never less than half full and dishes came out for the entire table at once, facilitated by multiple servers.\n\nThe sushi bar is where it is at though.  The O-toro sushi is absolutely amazing and very expensive at almost $40 for 2 bites.  They have some of the freshest fish I have tasted.\n\nThe food from the kitchen is just ok.  However, the miso black cod is to die for.  They cook it sous vide and it comes out perfectly!  It is a must try if you eat here.  There is also the crispy rice roll, which is memorable."
0,This place is huge.  I came up to the store from Tucson.  The store has lots and lots of employee's but only a few of them seemed interested in helping us.  Great selection of everything with retail prices comparable to Amazon.  The soda machines were out of almost everything witch may be unforgivable in Tempe heat.  Parking is more than ample.
0,"Too bad, so sad.....this smaller market chain needs to jump into high gear with employee training if they're gonna stay in the game. I like having a smaller canvas of grocery aisles sometimes....not every store needs to be SUPERsize....but this store is right down the street from a Safeway, a Wal-Mart SuperStore, and a Fry's....these stores all have way more variety and efficient systems and employees. It's just my humble opinion, but if I can get in and out of a 22-aisle market faster than a 14-aisle market, there is something worth looking into by the management."
0,Sorry Nacho Daddy but I'm giving ya 1 star. I've never walked out on a restaurants before ordering but we were not impressed by the atmosphere or the lack of mexican dishes offered. We were craving tacos and were disappointed to see only one dish on the menu. I know each restuarant has there own complimentary snacks brought to the table like bread or chips and salsa but here you give jalepeno corn bread muffins and sadly they weren't cooked all the way and were so tiny. I'm sorry that this wasn't a better experience for us.
1,"Mandarin Oriental is a lovely quiet spot in the center of the hubbub of Vegas. The hotel is entirely smoke free and quiet as there is no casino. The rooms are well appointed with a comfortable bed, large bathroom, and some great tech features. \n\nEverything in the room is remote controlled, from the lights, to the blackout curtains, to the temperature, and the alarm. You can even choose multiple settings for the alarm so you can wake to peaceful scenery on the tv screen while birds chirp and the curtains slowly open to let the morning light in. \n\nThere are a couple of did sides to this hotel which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  First, the pillows are terrible. They are large and hard. They don't have soft or foam pillow options. Second, the hotel is not connected to the rest if city center in a clean way. You have to walk up through a fees walkways to get to the Aria or through the taxi driveway to get to the street, neither of which is particularly safe or easy. \n\nOverall, I would return to the Mzndarin Oriental. They have several nice touches that bring it into the luxury hotel category. My favorites are the complimentary ride back to the airport in a comfy Mercedes, the bath salts for the huge tub, the personal high end service, and the technical integration of the functions in the room."
1,"This is a nice sophisticated restaurant with an \""international\"" cuisine, meaning that it is good for business entertaining.  You can bring arbitrary guests here and be pretty sure they will find something appropriate (which is pretty typical for a good hotel restaurant).  There is always a vegetarian dish and a fish dish, both of which are typically very good.\n\nThe place has a very nice ambiance, excellent service, and provides a pretty quick turn-around at lunch time, or even dinner time.  There is also an express menu  at lunch time that has a nice variety of items, an interesting collection of tastes, and which comes quite fast, including a selection of small desserts."
1,"Three words: SIN FREE FOOD.  Deli and grocery, plus they cater.  I review from the perspective of a meat-eating dessertaholic, although I enjoy great vegetarian food and try to limit meat to a couple meals a week.  They do sell some meat, but most sandwiches in the deli are great and meatless.  Wonderful, beautiful, delicious, locally-grown organic produce.  They also carry eco-friendly cleaning products.  It's like a tiny Whole Foods, only better."
1,"Here's one of the best downtown restaurant to go for a breakfast ! The food is good and the service excellent. And they actually serve real maple syrup. \n\nSo if you want a good place to eat in the morning : Hurry up and arrived before 9 am ( to avoid line up !) relax and enjoy a nice breakfast !  \n\n\nC'est une des meilleur endroit \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al au centre-ville pour d\u00e9guster un excellent d\u00e9jeuner, de plus le service est tr\u00e8s bon.\n\nSi vous chercher un bon endroit ou manger le matin : d\u00e9p\u00eacher-vous, arriver avant 9 heure am ( afin d'\u00e9viter la file) et relaxer en d\u00e9gustant un excellent d\u00e9jeuner !"
0,"My wife is pregnant and we were on our babymoon in Vegas for a week. We had a great time and I thoroughly enjoyed the food, but I need to give this a 1 start given that if we had eaten a week later, this salmonella outbreak could have caused immeasurable harm to our child."
0,"My family and I moved to Scottsdale over 20 years ago and I have always had a place in my heart for Don & Charlie's.  We used to go there often for birthdays/anniversaries/graduations, etc.  It was my birthday this week and my parents wanted to take me out so I said \""Let's go to Don & Charlie's, I haven't been there in I don't know how long\"".  Sadly, after having eaten there I believe that I made a mistake with this suggestion.  The restaurant itself hasn't changed since the last time I was there - it's still got wall-to-wall memorabilia, it still has the same old-school steak house ambiance, but the feeling that I got during and after the meal was really one of a restaurant that is resting upon its laurels and not doing much to deliver a quality product.  My Caesar salad was made with lettuce that was obviously old - it was not wilted, but it was very soft and floppy with no crunch to it whatsoever.  My father ordered the creamy coleslaw which bore a great resemblance to cabbage soup so high was the dressing to cabbage ratio.  My mother greatly enjoyed her house salad with a balsamic dressing but this was mostly because she thought the balsamic was the best that she had had in a long while.  All three of us ordered baby back ribs for dinner - my parents just had the ribs, I had a combo with the ribs and a filet.  All three of us remarked that the ribs were \""passable\"",  the meat was tough and fatty - not at all what I remember in terms of quality from when I used to eat there.  I have honestly had ribs that I found more enjoyable at casual restaurants like TGI Friday's or Ruby Tuesday's.  When you are charging $30 for a rack of ribs, they REALLY need to be better than \""acceptable\"" which was the highest grade I could offer on these.  While ordering our entrees, my mother asked which ribs were more tender and our server informed us that the beef ribs were the most tender, but they had sold out of their entire stock of beef ribs already.  Our reservation was at 6:30 - fairly early in the evening, so my mother's reaction was \""Really?\""  His response - \""Oh yes, they were actually sold out at 5:00 PM.\""  This speaks to a lack of organization and knowledge on the part of management - if you are running out of a popular item by 5 PM on a weekend before proper dinner service even begins then that indicates a serious problem.  My Filet was better than acceptable - it was not as good as I remember, but still very good.  Unfortunately my disappointment in the ribs was such that it overshadowed any feelings I may have had about the steak.  Our server was professional and courteous and I did not notice any of the issues with the hostesses that some others have reported, but I really have to say that I am disappointed in Don & Charlie's.  It's one thing to go back to a place you have a fondness for and find the experience lacking in relation what you remember - we all have a tendency to look at the past with rose-colored glasses I think.  This was a case of going to a place that I have a genuine fondness for and find the experience lacking in relation to what I consider acceptable for any high end restaurant.  I believe my grade of \""Meh. I've experienced better.\"" is completely accurate - I have experienced better at other steak houses, at other casual dining restaurants, even hole-in-the wall eateries where I used plastic utensils to eat my meal.  I say this as someone who has nothing but fond feelings for D&C's - you guys need to improve, because a wall full of signed baseballs and dim lighting will only take you so far."
1,Valenciana Paella is great
0,Worst company ever!!!! No customer service. If you call on Sunday you're out of luck and they don't care!!
1,"Love the chandeliers here.  Makes it feel fun and like I stepped into Sex and the City 3.  \n\nThis is strictly a review of the Casino and the ambiance.  I was not able to partake in being a hotel guest this time around.\n\nThe atmosphere feels very posh and high end.  And whoever designed those chandeliers probably doesn't have to dust them, that looks like a full time job.  I can picture their business card now, \""Cosmopolitan Chandelier Cleaner and Expert\"".  \n\nA bunch of great bars inside and the Wicked Spoon Buffet is here as well, albeit a bit of a trek to get to, that was like a maze.  I felt like people were watching us and laughing as we had to back track multiple times.  \n\nCasino offers lots of slot variety and although I played I did not win big.  \n\nI would recommend the Cosmo to the younger and more youthful crowd as this seems to offer the backdrop for a fun packed evening."
0,"Nonchalant attitudes all around. I felt that the customer service was quite poor. They never really cared until I came in to pay for the work I had done, which made me very surprised after reading all of the great reviews. They were also quite pricey. I will most likely not return to Honest 1."
1,"We tried really hard to go for a 3rd time on our 4 night stay but we couldn't because of scheduling issues..\n\nIncredible breakfasts (I tried both the huckleberry pancakes and white chocolate french toast). Incredible pastries with their homemade jams. Great service and decor.\n\nWhat else can you ask for?\n\nMy only gripe, and it's quite minor, is that they charge $6 for freshly squeezed orange juice but the portion is a bit too small. Like I said, minor."
1,"My favorite fake Mexican good place in Vegas!\n\nIt's delicious, not authentic.\n\nThis particular location has some great staff and is always fast. They do tend to be less friendly during the dinner rush, but that's human nature.\n\nI always get a salad, rotating between pork and chile roast beef. Their tortillas are the best you can get from a place of such caliber. I love them. I hear they make them with lard.\n\nAlso: horchata. Need I say mas?\n\n(Get it?)"
0,"I have been to the buffet twice the last time in June 2011, hated it both times. Friends say it is better now so I will give it one more try. Everything else about the HOTEL  is great."
0,"I dislike this place, first and last time I come here.  It's sad seeing people standing around talking and on their cell phones.  Placed my order and when I got my burger, it was all wrong. I waited an extra 25 minutes for my fixed burger. Not cool. Never again."
1,"We stayed at THE Hotel at the Mandalay Bay Resort in Las Vegas.  Since we were there we decided to try Aureole for dinner.  \n\nThe GOOD- \n1) The location and scenery were great! The 4-story wine tower is incredible to look at and fun to watch the ladies in their \""Mission Impossible\"" suits go to get the wine bottles.\n2) The food- read below for more information\n3) The service was as good as I've had at a fine dining establishment.  From the lady serving bread, to the man who took our order, to the Sommelier who recommended a nice bottle of wine.\n\nThe OK-\n1) The restaurant is a pricy place to eat.  It was over $300 for the two of us.  But I guess you have to expect that in Vegas!\n2) The wine list is quite cumbersome so if you are like us and aren't the smartest when it comes to wine, it's hard to pick one.  We're both fans of the red wines, especially Zinfandel's from the Dry Creek area (Healdsburg, Sonoma County) and they didn't have many wines from that region to choose from on their list.\n\nThe FOOD-\nWe both ordered from the Chef Vincent's Market Menu. The Salt and Pepper Calamari has got to be some of the BEST I've ever had.  It didn't need any dipping sauce and the calamari pieces were perfectly lightly breaded so that you could taste the calamari, not just the breading.  I had the seared Rainbow Trout and it was good.  I wasn't a fan of the skin being served along with the fish, but I ate around it and the fish was really tasty.  The white asparagus was overcooked for my taste, but the whole dish itself was prepared well and seasoned good.  My boyfriend had the American Wagyu Beef Skirt Steak and he LOVED it!  There was nothing left but an empty plate when he was finished.  For dessert I ordered the Salted Caramel Bomb cake and my boyfriend had the Orange Grand Marnier Creme Caramel.  Both desserts were great, but my favorite was the blood orange sorbet served with the Creme Caramel.  It was to die for!!!\n\nWe also ordered a bottle of 2007 Joseph Phelps Cabernet Savignon that was really good! \n\nOverall, our experience at Aureole was awesome.  Hopefully we will be back to enjoy another great dining experience!"
0,"I've been ordering from Rosati's for decades. I found them in Chicago and was overjoyed to find them again in Fountain Hills, AZ. However, the FH store has messed up my order on multiple occasions. They did so again last night when they failed to put cheese on my half of the pizza and then burnt it. When I called to let them know I was told there was a note on my account that I \""complained too much\"" and they would no longer serve me. So apparently the business model isn't to get the orders right but to cut off service to the customer if they rightly complain that the pizza is not done correctly.  They also claimed my husband was \""threatening\"" when he returned another incorrectly done pizza and he said he was going to inform corporate of the terrible service. Do not walk, run away from this terribly run franchise and get your pizza from a completely different Rosati's location."
0,"Food was okay, average at best, service was fast and friendly and their strawberry daiquiri was yum, but the beer came out of the tap warm, never good. This place definitely needs Jon Taffer."
0,"Mediocre food (similar  to Home Town Buffet) for a VERY expensive price and an extremely long wait in line. The locals might tell you its a 'Nice place for brunch' which is true if you're only going for the venue, but as far as the quality of the food goes, well...just don't do it, you\""ll be setting yourself up for disappointment like i did. If its a Vegas buffet your looking for, try Rio's world buffet! its hands down the best buffet Ive ever been to. The food Is great, the service is prompt & the wide selection of food will leave you feeling like a kid in a candy store."
0,Only got the fries and the black cow shake. Neither were good. Maybe next time will be different.
0,"I just can't with this place any more.  Red Robin used to be a fun family place, then they tried to make it upscale and got rid of the games, kids coloring pages, large balloons, fun posters etc....  I've never thought the food was that great, but the shakes are awesome and the kids used to like it. Going in there now is the utmost test in patience and tolerance.  The service is horrible (more because they seem understaffed than because the servers are inept), and there are fewer menu options and higher prices.  The number of kids in there and the noise level will drive you to drink; but not there, because the glasses are dirty and the manager will tell you that boogers on the glasses are just scratches.  Oh, and the bathroom is disgusting. If there is no soap and the trash is overflowing, then I'm not sure any of the employees are going in there let alone washing their hands.  In my opinion, Red Robin turned their backs on their customer base by trying to upgrade and make it more adult. I would never go there with all adults and it's not really fun for kids anymore.  Thanks but no thanks."
0,"It kills me to leave this review.  The food itself and array of food deserves five stars, however it's the staff that screws it up each and every time.  No exaggeration.  Every time something goes wrong that is truly annoying, such as getting cold cold soup served before your guest's  entree arrives EVEN IF THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO THINGS ORDERED (?) , a tuna melt comes out not melted and cold, etc, with the blessed receipt describing the order on the tray.  (?)   The timing of the food execution is horrible.!!! You can even see the staff standing in the back on top of each other waiting to take hot food out that is sitting on this massive counter without a heat lamp.   Hard to watch.  Hard to watch staff just stand around and talk when they best be grateful to be working in the first place....  THE BEST PART OF THE WHOLE THING: there are set positions in the kitchen where there are many hands that look over the order before it goes out, a manager or 'expediter'.....???? What is with the expediter?  Looking all dapper and bringing a mediocre, EVERY TIME, tray.   This, seriously? is a CONSTANT at this particular establishment.  The staff ruins the food experience.  Not cool, especially in today's economic market.  Panera is consistently great, especially in the service department.  This place needs to get its act together big time.Again the food rocks but the staff is an impediment."
0,"I just got my membership here and will be canceling it today. The customer service is absolutely horrible. The sales guy is demeaning and would not help us out at all with the guest pass, and then passively decided to send us what we were asking for AFTER we had walked out. Like many people reviews said, all they want is the money and unwilling to work with their customers in a respectable way."
0,"I came in here with my service dog once and was publicly embarrassed when the manager came up to me and told me to wait outside. And no dogs were allowed. When I said he was a service dog and that he provides service for my PTSD she told me that law doesn't apply in Arizona. I didn't even know how to react. Under the American Disabilities Act (which is federal law) you are allowed to bring in a service dog to help with post traumatic stress disorder and employees are only allowed to ask if it is a service dog and what service it provides. My dog is trained, doesn't bark, doesn't pay attention to any people, and just sits by my side. I've never been kicked out of a restaurant or store before. They didn't even bring me my drink. I just sat outside and they left it inside where I was no longer able to go."
1,"Qute some way down what must surely be the greatest street in the world, by location alone I'm probably a bit biased towards Bites, but nonetheless it's a great stop for good, honest food with just enough frills to make it more memorable than your average sarnie shop.\n\nA BLT, cake and a bottle of juice came to less than 4 notes on my visit, and such a feast can often cost you not far off double that in Edinburgh's more glamorous locales. Next time I'm down  this end, I'll definitely be back."
1,This place is amazing....the food is delicious and quick...worth the wait all though they said about 1/2 an hour we got seated in 20 mins...the staff is super friendly even though it's really slammed....I got the five spot best egg sandwich I have had in a long time...the organic apple juice is great as well as the strawberry honey lemonade....come down to matts big breakfast :)
1,The subs are always awesome here..today I got the hook and ladder light which is a good option if you want a lower calorie sub. On the other hand you can get the Italian sub which is full of salami and ham. Also they have a hot sauce bar that you can try a ton of different sauces which is kind of fun.
0,The only reason we used to come here every week was for the food. Needless to say the got rid of the best menu items they had again. They used to serve pizza - gone! Chicken avacado club sandwich ?  gone too! The only decent salad they had on the menu the chicken avacado with garlic...took it off the menu This place sux now & we certainly will not be back ever!
1,"Absolutely love this place and look forward to every visit. I try something different each time and have always really enjoyed the food.\n\nOne but of feedback, Please consider a more seamless ordering process as I end up pulling my wallet out to pay at least 3x per visit.....When ordering at the bar, entrees, and dessert."
0,"OK we arrived at 2am at HAZE last Friday night. The place was completely dead. Probably around 30 people in the club. We left after 10 minutes and spending $45 on two shots and one beer.\n\nBetter yet, some guy that was working for Lightgroup said we would get our cover comped ($20 for girls and $40 for guys) if we charge it to our room at ARIA. He went on about how he never seen everyone not get comped after charging it to the room.  Of course at the end of our trip,  both ARIA front desk and Mlife says they have nothing to do with Haze. Bunch of BS from Lightgroup. \n\nI have been here before it was OK. Basically a giant basement. After this trip, I would never go back. There are far better clubs like Marquee, Tao, and XS, that I don't mind paying cover for."
0,"For my first trip to a Vegas buffet I expected more. The food was tasty, and seemed to be of high quality, but there wasn't the variety that I heard so much about. For $35 a pop I expected more."

0,"One word to describe Over Easy: disappointing. \n\nIt would've been an OK breakfast place if it wasn't for all the hype. I've been trying to visit this place since I found out it was on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, so when I saw the deal on Doozy of a Deal, I purchased it right away. I made my own omelette with chicken, garlic, and spinach. The chicken was overcooked and the omelette and my hash browns were terribly greasy. My cousin ordered The Wolfpack and was also disappointed with her meal. It just didn't seem up to par with a place that was on Food Network.\n\nThe icing on the cake was the Over Easy Ice, their iced coffee. They could've given me a cup of water and cardamom and it wouldn't have tasted any different. We couldn't wait to get to the car to get some gum, to get the taste out of our mouths and even that didn't help. After reading other people's reviews, it looks like they hardly had any caradmom; so looks like Over Easy needs to figure out a way to uniformly make their coffee.\n\nSorry Over Easy, you were quite disappointing."
1,Great store and resteraunt they carry many israeli spices and things that are hard to find here. Just remember they are closed on sundays. Friendly and helpful staff also.

1,This is a great little place to grab sushi for lunch. The staff are friendly and the prices are fair. A great alternative to the typical lunch fair.
1,I went on a vacation to Arizona from Chicago and was told king gyros had great food. The food wasn't great it was beyond fantastic i don't know where to start. I kept on ordering out when I was there for 2 weeks and this is the only restaurant I would ever fly out for it I became a millionaire. Great family owned business and fantastic food.

0,"never again !! Sat. morning took my daughter to breakfast there. she had 2 breakfast burritos &.a hash brown. We sat down inside\nthe second burrito had a bug on it the kind with the pincher at the end so I took it to the cashier asked for the manager I show it to him with a confused look. he then showed it to i'm assuming she was the owner plain clothes behind the counter Asian lady. listen to this excuse it blew my mind she said that it must have flown on the burrito I told her there is no wings,then she says it can't be from us because everything is brought in frozen and if it was from them the bug would be dead! Really!"
0,WORST FOOD EVER. Don't waste a cent at this place. Staff was good and chips and salsa weren't bad but the entree was terrible. First you couldn't even tell what you were eating. Second the price was way to high for the quality of food. Third the food made me and my girlfriend sick all night and the next morning. Also you can eat at much better mexican food places for the same price. Blanco at the Biltmore for example.
0,"Okay, I want to like it more than I do but.....well, lets just dig into the review. First, know that I went there for lunch on a Saturday, not in the evening when it is in full swing, so maybe I missed part of the ambiance but honestly, I went there to try the food. \n\nFirst, I had the olives appetizer and based just on that, this place would be amazing. It was a small plate full of big, meaty, green olives, obviously warmed in a bath of live oil and served with a light sprinkle of salt and oh, so good. I would go back just for these. But, an appetizer does not a meal make so lets go on to the main course and side dish. \n\nFor lunch I had some sort of pasta which was advertised to have anchovies, lemon, and if i remember correctly, hot pepper. I also ordered a side of braised greens. The pasta, when it was served, came in a large white bowl and honestly, when I order a pasta dish over $10, I prefer it to be well...plated, on a plate. The dish also contained sauteed fennel which, while not unpleasant, was not expected, and it seemed, it was a bit dry. As for the braised greens, also served in a large white bowl and that was it, just the braised greens. Some cracked black pepper and some shaving of hard cheese, would definitely have helped round out the side dish (though at $3 I can't complain too much but make it $4 and bump it up a bit). \n\nFinally, the decor, nothing really stands out. Sen, right next door, has much more of an artistic edge so maybe they could kick up the look of the place a bit. So, take the review for what it is and if nothing else, go in the evening for a glass of wine and the olive appetizer (a steal at $5) but overall, it did not wow me as much as I expected from all the write-ups."
1,"OMFG!\n\nThis was by far the most expensive and memorable meal of my life. My wife and I dined here about two months ago. We shared the drink pairing. Two meals and one drink pairing came to $666. Though dare I say it, it was TOTALLY worth it.\n\nI love cooking and trying new foods. If you do, too, this is totally the place for you. You will love it. If you're not a foodie and not into unique cooking techniques, you'll probably find it overpriced and won't fully appreciate it. That being said, it was the perfect place for me.\n\nThere were four couples in our sitting. None of us knew each other, but we all seemed to be the same basic type. Foodies who make pretty good money but aren't exactly rich who are willing to pay for a one-of-a-kind once-in-a-lifetime dining experience.\n\nWe all LOVED our food. In fact, at one point the chefs left to get something from the kitchen and one of the guys said, \""Good, they're gone. Now we can lick our plates.\"" We all chuckled but all highly considered it. No one wanted to waste one single drop of deliciousness.\n\nI would say my favorite course was the chickpea soup with iberico pork. The \""chickpeas\"" were filled with iberico pork and chickpea broth. It was amazing. I had never had iberico pork and instantly fell in love.\n\nI am not a fan of desserts and there were quite a few served. However, I have to admit that I liked every single one of them. My favorite involved olive oil, cocoa powder and mascarpone or something similar. We were instructed to drag our spoons through the olive oil and into the cocoa powder. Sounded weird but WOW!\n\nMy wife is a connoisseur of flan and said that hands down e's was the best she had ever had. I don't care for flan, but I had to agree this flan was delish! \n\nI could go on and on about every single course. But lots of people have already done that, and it would be very hard to truly do any of the courses justice.\n\nAside from the food itself, the other awesome aspect was being able to watch the creation and plating of many of the courses. Everything was done with such care and perfection. The chefs used droppers and tweezers to carefully add the most delicate items. I was in awe throughout the whole dinner and was envious of the chefs who get to work with such great ingredients every day.\n\nAbout midway through the dinner, the chefs told us to look behind us. When we did, we saw none other than Jose' Andres. He was in town for Uncork'd and stopped in for a moment to see how we were all doing. We all expressed our amazement at everything we had tried thus far.\n\nWhen we finished our meal, I saw Jose' sitting at one of the tables in Jaleo. I asked one of the waiters if it would be okay for me to go up to him and ask for his autograph. He said that Jose' was being interviewed by a food magazine but should be done shortly and I could wait at the bar and approach him once he was done. I did so, and once his interview was over I was able to catch him before he went back into the kitchen. He autographed my menu and my wife took a picture of us. The people from the food magazine were still around and their photographer snapped a few pics too. It was a perfect ending to a perfect night.\n\nI mentioned earlier that this was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. However, I can't imagine never going back. Maybe I should change that to a once every 5 years event. Or if I get a big raise, maybe once a year. Even my wife who usually gets upset when we go to higher-priced places as she thinks it's not worth it (and that's with a bill about 1/6 of e'), said that the meal was totally worth it."
1,"I had seven years of calcium build up on the tile, rust spots on the 3M quartz plaster, and dirt stains I did not think would ever be clean again on my 45,000 gallon pool. Bullfrog told me they would work hard to get it looking better. They did not promise that everything would come clean, but that they would do their best. My husband is a clean freak and a perfectionist. He looked at it when the work was complete and declared, \""It looks brand new.\"" The owner came out every day to check on the progress, and to make sure I was happy. He called me two different times to ensure my satisfaction, and made recommendations on how we could keep our neglected pool looking its best going forward. They were complete professionals throughout the whole process and seemed to personally care about my pool and my satisfaction. I would highly recommend them."
1,"A definite place to make a reservation if you are staying at Mandalay Bay.  We enjoyed our meal and the waitstaff was the absolute best.  Totally unpretentious and enjoyable meal.  The trio of duck fat fries were awesome along with the sauces.  I made the mistake of saying to my husband \""that sauce is good, what it it?\""  he replied, \""ketchup.\""  Oops.  \n\nI ordered the Colorado lamb which was tender and cooked/grilled perfectly.  I devoured everything.  We also had a side of brussel sprouts with bacon and creamed spinach.  \n\nEven though we were absolutely stuffed we decided to split a dessert, beignets with butterscotch pudding.  Soooo goood.  Can't wait to try Mina's other restaurants, Seablue looks really good."
1,"On our last visit to Las Vegas we decide to try Rollin Smoke BBQ.  We arrived at around 6PM and they were already out of brisket.  It is what I use as a benchmark for BBQ so I can only provide feedback based on what we had.  We opted for the Baby back ribs and the beef ribs.  Overall the food was great.  I would certainly recommend the beef ribs.  They were fantastic and meaty.  The service was prompt.  This is a dive so don't expect a fabulous setting, but we knew that going in.  The staff were very friendly and the place was packed."
0,"I went to ER with terrible pain on my left side and it could barely breathe... My chest Xray was wrongly diagnosed and i was sent home from ER still in total pain... I had never been to the ER in my life so i went home thinking maybe i was being a baby about the pain.... 2 days later i woke up in the middle of the night in so much pain even worse than before... I told my husband to drive me to the ER and he was like \""Why, they didn't admit you last time?\"" I told him i don't care and to take me NOW.... I get there and they bring me back for another chest Xray and my left lung was almost collapsed... The ER thanked me for coming back so soon....

I'm actually here now getting an oil change, which is a steal compared to other shops around town: 3 oil changes for $50!  Would much rather wait for my car to be serviced here... fridge full of free sodas and water, and usually they have snacks like bagels and donuts.  Very happy that they finally figured out that giving away wifi to their customers was a no-brainer."

1,"I grew up playing Maryvale, from when I was 5 I took John Martin's Summer Swing School. It would be all day on the golf course, kind of a summer camp kinda deal. I probably have played here 200+ times over the past 20 years. There have been a lot of changes both for the good and the bad.\n\nThis is a classic William Bell design, with elevated tees and greens, mostly bunkered in the front. It's compact in design and everything flows together well, and there are some great risk reward opportunities. Some of the standout holes are:\n\n#3, a great 420yd par 4 dogleg right. It is really tempting to try to cut the corner, and if you hit a right side drive high enough, you can carry the mounds and trees and leave yourself a short wedge in. Hit in the trees and its an easy bogey.\n\n#5 is a very tempting driving hole. at 302 yards one can put the ball on the green if you hit even a somewhat long ball. If you miss either way, you'll have a tough time saving par. I've probably had less pars here than any other hole on the course, its always birdie or bogey.\n\n#13 is very much the same situation as 5, but you have a huge bunker in front of the green. Again, a big shot off the tee can put you in a great birdie position, or a nice cut will put you on the green, but bogie is easy. \n\nThe place is never in good shape, but the course is fun, it's cheap, and appropriate for the advanced player or a beginner. The course is as tough or as easy as you want it to be. My days of shooting consistent low 70's are over here, but I still have fun."
0,"This was not my goal. I had heard good reviews over the years of the Bootlegger Bistro but our visit on a Wednesday evening at 10:00 pm was not good for several reasons. \n\n1. First, the (very) good part. The history of the Bootlegger is alive and well on the walls and the decor. We sat in the old booths where apparently many of the early Las Vegas icons may have sat - fun to chat about. But better yet, one (or more) of the video monitors plays continuous clips of Las Vegas in the 60s and 70s - again, fun and entertaining.\n\n2. Now, unfortunately, the food was simply bland. No Italian bistro should have bland food at any point, it's a fundamental flaw or here, 'the kiss of death.' When an Italian place serves a generic tasting sauce, it's time for one of those TV shows to enter the picture and accomplish some major changes.\n\n3. We ordered Eggplant Parmigiana and a chicken dish, Pollo All Angelo. Each of ours dishes had no taste to it other than a series of generic ingredients, of the canned type, placed together and heated. The pasta was a bit undercooked but okay.\n\n4. At one point the two servers both disappeared for about 5 minutes after another group came in. The bartender was 'quietly' yelling, i.e. arms up in frustration, looking all about, making the gestures along with some additional bar guests seated nearby.\n\n5. Unexplainable part. I had ordered a Coke, it was normal. Then middle of the dinner, I ordered another one, refill, it was strangely different, much more syrup-like.\n\n6. In sum, the food was ~ I sincerely dislike saying this ~ bland at every point, the service was fast-food like, meaning adequate but intermittent definitely, but the atmosphere was pleasant. Unfortunately, that is not nearly enough to return. I would rather eat great food at a dive or 'hole in the wall.'\n\n7. As for some of the other reviews I see here - I highly suspect one or two as possibly being 'affiliated' with the place. The words just seem too simplistic in one case, too broad in another. Now, if I hear there was new management and an improved menu at some point, we may re-visit, but no time soon. \n\nStrange thought here - knowing that so many famous people had eaten at the Bootlegger in the prior locale, and hearing about this place for, well, decades, I was looking forward to a good dinner with my wife. It simply failed. The irony is that I had just shared with my wife that Olive Garden doesn't essentially cook anything, no grills, but uses microwaves to re-heat all the pre-packaged items sent to each store."
0,"I am actually writing this review having gotten off the plane after travelling for 12 hours (when the flight should've been more than half that time) on my first and only encounter with Spirit Airlines. I totally regret not having read the reviews before booking my flight - cheap fares are definitely too good to be true with this airline.\n\nEmbarked on a flight from Las Vegas to La Guardia (NYC) airport, via stopover in Detroit.\n\nFound out a few hours before my flight departed that there was a charge for carry-on and check-in luggage - $100 at the gate if you don't buy it beforehand! Daylight robbery. So I paid $40 for my carry-on, but when I arrived at the airport asked if this could be refunded as my luggage fit inside the 'test' compartment at check-in. The service attendant basically waved me away and told me I'd have to pay as it was 'outside the dimensions'. Whatever. \n\nDeparture time was 8.12am. After arriving at the airport 2 hours before the flight departure time, and upon arrival at the gate we were told that the flight was potentially overbooked and that they were seeking volunteers to take a later flight. This was the first scare. However the flight ended up departing approximately on time. Too good to be true? Read on.\n\nArrived in Detroit for a 'brief' stopover. Original time of departure was meant to be 4pm. Passengers were told nothing and it was only until I checked the departure screen that there was now a 2 hour delay, scheduled for 6pm! Went back to the lounge and then was told that the flight would be departing at 5.15pm - no reason was given for the delay.\n\nAll passengers boarded for an anticipated 5.15pm departure. It was only when we were all seated and waiting in the tarmac that the captain decided to tell us that La Guardia airport was closed due to bad weather in NYC. Funny though, that a fellow passenger called out that her friend was departing on a Delta plane at the same time and on the same flight leg, yet her flight was not delayed? The attendant did not seem to know how to respond to this. She called the captain and the captain's best line was that the weather was bad and was causing delays everywhere. Not sure if this was true but after reading MANY negative reviews about Spirit on Yelp, it seems that this is not the first time they have acted dishonestly and used the weather as an excuse for their sloppy practices.\n\nTo top this off, we were then told we could not disembark the plane (since we didn't know if our flight would actually depart due to the so-called weather problems in NYC) and if we chose to do so, would not be able to re-board! The attendant also let us know that Spirit would not be giving out free snacks or water for the delay, and that they would have to 'seek permission from the company first.' What the hell!? This was now beyond a joke. In my entire experience of flying, I have never encountered such unprofessional level of service by an airline. I don't understand how this company is still in business! \n\nAfter waiting on the tarmac, we finally found out at 6.30pm we were able to fly. We landed in NYC at 8.15pm, nearly 3 hours later than the original arrival time of 5.45pm. \n\nIf we really want to stop this airline running altogether, I'd suggest lodging a complain with DOT. I even Googled it and there's an actual website on how to shut down Spirit Airlines!! Check here: http://www.spiritairlinesfacts.com/how-to-shut-down-spirit.html\n\nNever flying this airline again!"
1,"Ive been here a number of times now and can safely say its one of my favorite tex mex restaurants in town. To me its Mexican with a texas kick. its not your traditional Mexican menu. I like that! \nMixed drinks are great, Ive tried a couple and im not a mixed drink kinda guy. but ill do it here.\nI don't know why manzettis (if that's how you spell it) didn't make it. the layout of this place is perfect in my book. \nStaff is very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. if they tell you its good it is."
1,"If you like fabric at all, or have a crafty bone in your body, or are enticed by quirky shops in the slightest, you will dig Loom. You'll dig it hard. They have every single cool, unusual, hard-to-find, hilarious, arbitrary or otherwise rad piece of cloth ever printed.\n\nI'm not a particularly crafty person, I'm actually a particularly clumsy person, but after I saw a bolt of sexy firemen fabric I knew I needed to find an excuse to make something with it. I knew it deep down inside, the way your mom knows when you've been dumping eight tablespoons of sugar on your Corn Flakes because she refuses to buy Lucky Charms.\n\nSo I came up with a project that required numerous narrow strips of fabric. Unfortunately, the woman working there politely informed me, they have a half-yard minimum. As panic started to set upon my realization that I was going to have to buy $100 worth of fabric that I would never use, the owner chimed in that she wouldn't mind cutting me any size piece I wanted. *That's* how you do it guys: don't make me ask you to be accommodating, that makes us both look bad. \n\nI ended up with 15 different patterns in my bag; photo-realistic astronauts, graphic \""Yowza!\"" text, pin-up girls, tiny birds in lime green, houses in a row that look hand drawn, brass knuckles embedded with rhinestones, cats and dogs dressed up as generals and sergeants and neon lace. I passed on the glittering rainbow unicorns: I think that fad is on its way out (finally and thank God).\n\nI would reupholster everything in the world, including the hideous \""igloo\"" downtown and my laptop, if I could do it with bolts of stuff from here."

0,"I'm an Oxford girl myself, and so always had a slight, lingering suspicion of anything with the word Cambridge in the title; in the case of the Cambridge bar, this unease was exacerbated by the fact that the Oxford Bar is just down the road.\n\nHowever, I'm sure I went in with an open mind, determined to enjoy myself.  Which I did, mostly. It's a lively and buzzy place that attracts a young-ish crowd, noisy, but still possible to have a conversation there.\nI've just got a couple of gripes about this place; firstly, I ordered a veggie burger that cost about six pounds, was burnt, and didn't even come with chips! Which was disappointing.  \n\nSecondly, and this may seem petty but I have strong feelings about these things, as the evening drew to a close, my friends and I decided to have just another half pint each before going home, so I went to the bar clutching what I thought was a more than sufficient amount of money.  I had, of course, calculated how much it would cost by halving the price of a normal pint, because that's the way it works in every other pub.  That makes sense, because it's the same beer but you're only having half as much of it, so it should cost half the amount, right? Well, not in the Cambridge, where a half is \u00a32.90, as much as a whole pint costs in most other establishments.  I was outraged more on principle than about the actual money.\n\nSo, I shall not be frequenting this place, and have had my irrational prejudice confirmed: places named Cambridge are not to be trusted."

Since we've been long time fans of Tom on Top Chef we thought we'd give it a try.  We weren't surprised by the prices (it is on the strip, after all) and expected the sandwiches to be top notch.  We ordered the slow roasted pork and flank steak.  I should've known this was going to be a problem when I didn't see the cheddar in the steak sandwich.  It said \""aged cheddar\"" on the menu, why wasn't it on my sammie??   Ehhhh, I wasn't going to walk all the way back to the eatery from the pool.  I thought to myself, \""I can deal, I'm sure the rest will be yummy\"".  Boy was I wrong.  If you like some bread with a sliver of meat and a pound of salt, this is the place for you!   I'm pretty sure the high school kid at subway can assemble a nicer sandwich than this.  Not only were they thrown together, there was barely any stuff on the bread...  not to mention my forgotten cheese.   And it was sooo salty!  \n\nSorely disappointed, Tom.  How come all the other food you make on TV looks so good?  You've really cashed in on your fame.  I'd write him a note expressing my concern but I know it won't reach him and he's too busy raking in $$$ to care. \n\nLooking for a good sandwich on the strip?

Saw they were open til 10pm, drove 20 minutes to get there, arrived at 8:40p only to be told that they didn't feel like making us a deep dish pizza because it took too long and we could get a thin crust instead. The restaurant was empty aside from us and we were shocked- who does that? They said they say they close at 10 but like to get out by 9/9:30. My advice? Call ahead to make sure they are even open or in the mood to make you a pizza. I mean, who does that???"

Ew.\nWhen I got to the car & looked at it some more in the sunlight, I decided it wasn't to my satisfaction after all. I went back in & asked if there was anything Jong could do to fix the stripey orange look I was getting instead of the ombr\u00e9. He told me to come next week.

He said why did I walk out then?\nAll the while he was working on my hair, he was also working on his family member's hair. Speaking in Korean the entire time. I explained I saw he had to assist other customers, & at the time it seemed adequate. I was gone for no more than 10 minutes when I came back asking for him to fix it. An argument began. He misunderstood me. Frustrated, I took my tip back, and left. I cried about my hair for about 10 minutes in my car in the parking lot.

0,"We got here before opening (they open an hour after the preserve opens) and were completely ignored by several people who walked past us.\n\nWolfgang, here's some helpful tips to increase business:\n\n1) We just wanted coffee, tea, and a sweet roll. You need to have a separate section or counter in the front that opens early and has these items for purchase.\n\n2) If your staff passes by someone standing in the doorway and makes eye contact, they should at least greet the person with a hello.  I know that it was before opening, but if your door is unlocked and people are buzzing around, it's common courtesy to acknowledge a person.  We just wanted to ask if we could come back when you open and get coffee or tea to go."
1,"I'm back In Vancouver now and find myself missing this gym, it had everything I needed and waaay more.  It's huge (and clean), with tons of equipment, has a shake and food bar, a shop with protein supplements and vitamins, but most importantly has an amazing room for boxing and kickboxing training.  \n\nOver the course of a few sessions I worked with a trainer named Matthew.  Though I'd been training in kickboxing for about 6 months I'd picked up some bad habits.  Matthew brought it back to basics for me and pushed me until I had given up nearly every shred of energy I had.  He's got a great demeanour without being forceful, making me want to work harder and harder, and he's got a great eye for body alignment, showing me subtle ways to get more out of my movements.  \n\nNext time I'm back in Montreal, however brief, I'll be sure to book a training session with him again."
0,"We found a coupon for this restaurant in the 89113 booklet and decided to try it since we had a great experience at the FireFly and another tapas restaurant at the Aria.\nAlthough the restaurant had a nice atmosphere with 3-4 flat screens, the music was too loud.\nWe ordered the tuna tartar which was mixed with too much mayo but the chips were wonderful; the shrimp cerviche, which the shrimp was too tough and the chips weren't that great; the eggplant cannelloni, which was too salty; and 3 skewers with a yummy sausage, a tasteless steak and an overcooked shrimp.  \nWaiter was okay; the waterboy or the person that kept our drinks filled was very customer service oriented.\nWill we be back?....No"

1,"I came here for my annual mole checkup a few months ago, and was delighted to meet Dr. Davey!  It's kind of awkward having a man do a full body mole check, but he had a female assistant stand in, and made conversation the whole time to put me at ease.  He is so nice and very knowledgeable- just what you want in a dermatologist!  Also, when I asked about Botox he didn't try to pressure me to get more than was necessary or push it on me right then and there. He just clearly gave me the facts and a quote, which I really appreciated.  No pushy sales approach, just helpful info.  Also, he told me that he does the injections himself- unlike a lot of places that have nurses or PAs do them instead of the doctor. Bonus!  The office was beautiful and clean, and the staff was super nice.  You can tell he's from KY - he's got those good Southern manners.  Also, he's very affordable for how experienced he is and how gorgeous the office is!  Bottom line: if you want a great doctor who will make your skin beautiful but not be pretentious and \""Scottsdale\"" about it- then go see Dr. Davey!"
0,"BEWARE!! Horrible service!! Food is mediocre!! Unprofessional and rude, liars and SCAMMERS!! Walked in for a take out, paid for my food and asked them how long it will take. they said about 15mins. I was in a rush so I decided to get gas which is in the same shopping complex. Told the lady/owner I will be back to pick up my food. So when we came back 15 mins later, I sent my husband to get the food and I stayed in the car with my baby. He was in there a few mins and comes out saying we never ordered. So at this point I was heated for now I am running late for work. I go in there and the lady again denies I was in there 25 mins earlier and that she doesn't remember. Are you frickin' kidding me?? Now at this point I was irate and fuming. I noticed there was a camera and told the lady to run it. This is just 25 minutes later. She was blabbering and says ok we'll cook the order!! No apologies instead she tells me its been a long day... RETARDS!! I know I should've asked for a receipt but I figured I was only gone 15 mins. Camera was just probably for display and when I mentioned that, she kinda backed off. I wonder how many other people they scam!! They need to be shut down!! AND AGAIN FOOD IS NOT GOOD... we we're rushing and hungry that I didn't even think they might have put something in my food... Well KARMA will get them if ever!!"
1,"I really, really like this place. There are plenty of yogurt places in Scottsdale, but none are as clean or have such a fresh and delicious variety of toppings. My favorite flavors are Tart Noveau, Strawberry Milkshake, Blueberry, Strawberry Banana, Red Velvet... but everything is delicious. Top it off with some strawberries (theirs are always fresh and sweet!), blueberries, a few chocolate chips, mochi, and those divine chocolate raspberry cups, and a dash of rainbow sprinkles- you're all set! The decor is also very trendy and modern and the staff are always wiping the machines and topping bar down. \n\nThe ONLY reason this place gets four stars is the price. 45 cents an ounce??? That's 50% more expensive than Yogurtland, and at least 10 cents more expensive than anywhere else! I love this place, but I don't think it's completely worth the huge price jump. They should have more coupons! :)\n\nOverall, this place rocks. Just be careful to not go overboard or you'll find yourself paying nearly 8 bucks for a cup of froyo ;)"
1,"Just tried this place on Friday night for the 1st time...and loved it. Very much like the little noodle restaurants hidden on little side streets all over Hong Kong. Just a small dive eatery, basic tables and minimal decor, chopsticks and spoons sitting in holders on the table for patrons to get themselves. The clientele was heavily Asian when we were there...as every table looked to have at least one Asian person, lending a degree of authenticity to the place. The menu is minimal, maybe 40 items in total, including soups and appetizers, and split in to four primary sections: appetizers, \""special\"" noodle dishes, soup noodles, and fried noodles. The noodles are made fresh for each dish, and after you order, you can watch the noodle guy making your noodles through a big window that separates the kitchen from the dining room. He pulls and stretches the dough, and 5 minutes later you're eating those noodles. Great noodles too!\nFor soup, we had the fish ball soup, which is roundish, white balls of fish stuffed with a ground pork mix, and cooked in soup. Very good. \nThe first dish that came out was the shrimp with corn noodles in curry, and that was great. We simply devoured that dish. We also had the seafood noodle soup, and that was good. Not as full of flavor as the curry dish, but a nice, standard Asian soup. A nice feature was the amount of squid included in the soup, and the cuttlefish ball.\nFinally, we had #34 on the menu, the spicy beef with the XO sauce (though we actually substituted chicken for the beef), and it definitely has a little bit of chili powder and kick. Not extremely hot, but just enough spice to mix with the flavor to produce a great dish. The only thing I'd change is that they were pretty heavy on the amount of onions in the dish, but overrall great dish.\nService was quick, efficient, tables are turned quickly, and food came out quickly. On top of that, the place is CHEAP! Most of the dishes are $5.95, at best, and several are under $5."

1,"I've been to the Grand Canyon before but this was my first time seeing The West side of the Canyon.  I enjoyed this trip but skipped one of the stops.  First off, $$ shouldn't really be the judge of this situation.  If you don't like spending $$, don't spend money and shut up about it.  If it's going to make you bitter to spend a little more money to go on the sky walk, then go to the other parts of the canyon and save a few bucks.  \n\nThe skywalk isn't a must but it definitely was interesting.  You get to stand over the canyon but you are very close to the edge. Upon entering there is a sign that warns that the skywalk is earthquake resistant only up to 8.0 (which was very scary).  The skywalk itself felt very sturdy and you get a photographer who will take as many pictures as you want so that later you can choose some and buy then if you choose to do so.  They are pricey $30/print, but we just bought one and it worked out since we didn't have anyone to take unlimited pix of us otherwise (only two of us).\n\nI preferred Guano Point to the Skywalk.  The Skywalk was fun but I felt more impressed at the top of the little mountain on Guano Point.  You don't have to pay extra for that and you get this tremendous 360 view of the canyon, you can take AMAZING photos from here but be prepared to climb a little for the best view.  Also, at Guano Point you can eat lunch on top of the world!\n\nFor anyone coming from Vegas, the drive is pretty long but it's beautiful!  Once you get off the freeway the roadside gets prettier and prettier as you near the canyon because you enter a Joshua Tree forest.  Beware of cows and jackrabbits. We almost hit a cow on our way in (they're right by the road).  Also, be warned that there is a long dirt road on the way to the canyon.  I enjoyed the dirt road but it was at least 30mins work of rugged landscape (very pretty, we played cowboy songs).  There is also a ranch leading up to the canyon and you can stop there for beer and food.  \n\nAll in all the trip was long but I enjoyed it.  It was a different view of the canyon than I had ever seen before.  Not being able to take my camera on the skywalk was super annoying, something done to make money off of turning part of the res into a tourist attraction.  It makes sense so I didn't much mind.\n\nThe buses that take you to the different locations were very nice charter buses, so don't worry about getting an old beat up twinkie bus because that didn't happen.\n\nHonestly I would've done this trip just for the drive out, I hadn't seen a Joshua Tree forest in a very long time (haven't been on a road trip in a while) and the dirt road was a hoot!  \n\nDON'T SKIP GUANO POINT, ITS THE BEST VIEW!\n\nAlso: keep your children close because they do not rope off the edges of the canyon, anyone can just fly off if they feel like it so watch them!\n\nI'm giving this a 4star just because it cost so much money to do the things we did.  It was worth it but so are the other parts of the canyon that cost less to see and provide more of a view. This was a unique experience and I loved it!"
1,"We own a boat and travel out to Canyon Lake several times a year.  Our first plan of the day was to take the boat out and entertain our out -of -state guests; however, the weather was rainy and cold.  So we opted for the heated comfort of The Dolly Steamboat.  What a treat!  We went out on Sunday, February 8th, 2009 on the 1pm, 90 minute cruise.  We had a fantastic guide, Captain Tom.  This was a beautiful cruise.  We even saw waterfalls (which is a rare treat in AZ).  There is not a bad seat on the boat.  The boat goes up the canyon, turns around and heads back to the dock.  The snacks and drinks available for purchase were very reasonable.  We had 5 hot chocolate, a coffee and 2 popcorns for $8.  Great deal!"
1,"This charming little cafe made my day-  the atmosphere is charming, clean, bright and warm....and the wait staff and cook were friendly and welcoming.... but the food?  the food was the best part.\n\neclectic, delicious AND reasonably priced.\n\nI got an eggplant panini--called espaniclata or something- which came with a side salad.  The quesadilla I split with my coworker was surprising and sweet- good for a snack or dessert.  I wasn't a big fan of the chai (I stole a sip from a friend)---it was Indian, just not what I am used to- not as sweet\nAnyways, I went on Friday for lunch, and liked it so much I had to go back Sunday.  Again, fantastic.  I think I found a new love."
0,"Came here around 950pm on a Sunday night. We were the only ones in drive thru. I would've chose to go inside but dt is only available. So we ordered a king Caesar wrap, a chicken baja flatbread, a beach bum smoothie and a half turkey sandwich. So first of all, it took 5 minutes for us to order. The person greeted right away, but I have no idea what the hell he was saying. He spoke so fast and then I tried to order, but he didn't respond. So a minute or two pass by & I keep saying \""Hello?\"" Then he finally takes our order for the flatbread and wrap and then stops responding.... We keep saying \""hello\"" again and then another minute later he finally responds again. And he responds confused saying \""ooookay...\"" Like, why was he so confused? \n\nSo, we pull up to the window and he goes, \""So what was your order?\""\nI repeat everything again.\n\""So did you still want the wrap and flatbread or just the smoothie?\""\nYes we want all the food we ordered.\n\""Oh okay shoot hold on let me fix that\""\n\nLike, when did I ever cancel the flatbread and wrap? Lol. Then I ask for the smoothie to be charged on one credit card, and the other 2 items on the other card. He closes the window, then runs everything on one card for some reason. Opens the window again, stares at the cards like it's something foreign then says, \""sorry hold on you want what?\"" I tell him again, then he closes the window and calls someone else over to help him redo the transaction. \nI also hand him my friends lvac card for a discount, and he was very confused. He stares at that stupidly too. I respond, it's for the gym discount? Then he closed the window and doesn't ask about it again.\n*Everything so far took 10 minutes already.*\n10 minutes later, we finally get our food. I had to ask for the stamp card back. He forgot he even had it I guess. \n\nWe get home and look at our receipt and he didn't even give us the discount. My flatbread was okay, kind of dry and barely had any sauce in it. The smoothie was good and the sandwich, but my friends Caesar wrap was very sloppy and had old lettuce in it! I can't believe how horrible of a visit we had. That Miroslav guy was so rude!"
1,"Great Show! Nathan appeared on the show America got talent, he got 2 beautiful assistant, very entertaining, and the sound system is perfect. There's a photographer \nGoing to greet you before you fall in line and take picture of you, you can get it after the show if you want, and not bad for $20 it includes a DVD of his show. Inside the show you can\nOrder stuff we only ordered soda. My over all experience is great."
1,Limited menu but the baby back ribs were awesome.  Also had a great marguerita.  DJ music.
1,"Lots of variety, lots of different prices, nice styles, convenient location!"
1,"Graveyard of Champions (Picture #69 is the menu for Summer '14 -until the end of August?) is the first cocktail I ordered today, wonderfully fresh and fitting for summer. I partially agree with Sandra R. in that the cucumber ice cube is a bit too much, the cocktail was much better when I let my drink sit and some of the cucumber mixed with the drink. Cocktails are meant to be drank slow, sipped and enjoyed. Something my generation does not understand, unfortunately. But the cube was damn large, maybe two or three smaller cubes would be better? Done talking about ice cubes now.\n\nThe second drink was their twist on an old fashioned cocktail. I say twist because I believe he added an olive instead of a cherry and used soda water versus plain. Beautiful. I appreciate a bartender/bar equipped with a muddler despite how simple. \n\nIn all the decor was good. Eye pleasing without taking away from conversation. I went midday, the windows in the front brought in sufficient but not too much daylight. All the metals & classic seating fit together very well. I myself not so impressed with the Buddha chandelier. Whatever.\n\nGreat friendly, knowledgeable bartenders, caring enough to offer waters to people drinking (including myself), bars in this town need to do this more. Great lively atmosphere, no smoking inside (I smoke, don't mind this), some gaming & in addition to the craft cocktails there is also a few craft beers on the menu. They accept credit cards & have clean bathrooms. \n\nI dinged them for the limited/street parking but this definitely won't be my last time here."

0,"I have had a few \""okay\"" experiences with this florist in the past.  On Valentines Day 2013 my husband purchased their largest red rose arrangement for $300.  The presentation was nice, if a little dated, but sadly within just a couple days the flowers died.  Every other time I have received flowers from this company they have not lasted as long as other florists or even the cheap flowers from the supermarket.  I would rate the quality of the arrangements from this florist as 3/5.\n\nMost recently, my husband attempted to place a last minute balloon order at 3:30 pm from this company over the phone.  Their website states they are open until 5pm so he thought that may be enough time to pick up the balloons.  He was advised by the person who took his order that the balloons would be ready for pick up the same day.  When he arrived to the shop at 3:50 pm the shop was closed early and the store door hours stated they closed at 4pm.\n\nHow did this miscommunication happen?  Well, anyone who is thinking about ordering from this florist should be aware that the phone number they advertise actually goes to an off site call center that represents themselves as in-house.  My husband was lied to that he could get the balloons the same day when the florist closed early that day without informing their call center ordering team.  When my husband called the phone number (that they list on their website and on the door of their shop) as he stood outside the CLOSED shop, the person on the phone still tried to represent themselves as a florist on site and that the store was indeed open.  This was very frustrating and the miscommunication and outright lying wasted his time\n\nI understand that sometimes last minute orders cannot be filled but this business needs to update their website with their ACTUAL hours and make sure that whatever ordering service they use is updated with any exceptions to their hours. The call center ordering team that their phone number directs to also needs to be honest about the fact they are not on site."
1,A perfect dinner experience in a shabby hotel. I would have never expected that kind of restaurant within the Ballys Hotel. I sat at the bar with full menu. The staff is super friendly. Stephanie took care of me and made dinner a super pleasant experience. \nThe bread called popovers are phenomenal. They even give you a little card with the recipe. I started with Tuna Tartar. That came on ice with a super tasty yet slightly spicy sauce. Then I had the dry aged bone in New York strip steak. OMG. That char was tasty and cooked to perfection. Huge portion. I wasn't able to finish the Bruxelles sprouts. Those tasted like my mother used to make them. I must admit. This place is a gem in a old place. Will be back for sure.
0,"This is not the first time I have received unfriendly service, but I figured everyone deserves a second chance. I was apparently wrong. I expressed my dissatisfaction to the manager Dennis; however, I was told to go to a different location (completely out of my way) or return to this location and ask for the manager (he will hook me up). I say no thank you. If you cannot satisfy your customers the first or second visit, then there will not be a third."
1,"Since moving to their new location next to the 131 Main on East, I've become a bigger fan of East Blvd Bar & Grill. The old location was dark and smoky, whereas the new location has front windows that open up similar to garage doors to allow patrons to enjoy the beautiful weather in the spring, summer and fall. \n\nThe service is always very good, and the menu has multiple vegetarian options, which is nice. But ultimately, this is a bar, so expect bar food and good drinks. The Bloody Mary's are very good, as are the mixed drinks; they definitely are not shy with the liquor-to-mixer ratio.\n\nThe best meal on the menu is the tuna salad with fries. The handcut fries are beyond delicious (ask for cheese on them and then dip in ranch - I realize that is very unhealthy, but let's be honest - you're at a bar). The tuna salad is the best in town, and you can get  it served cold or as a tuna melt.\n\nGreat place to have a quick lunch or meet up with friends on a nice day for some appetizers and drinks on a sunny afternoon. There is plenty of parking in the covered deck, and being on East Blvd, it's very close to multiple boutique stores for shopping as well as Freedom Park if you'd like to try to work off some of your meal after you eat."
0,"Thai Express is one of the places that I would not mind going when I need food quickly or when I simply do not want to cook for the night. I tried this one and ordered for a to-go. Now I do not plan to go back at all because of two reasons.\n\nFirst, it's dirty. The place is really dirty that I could see flies on limes (yes, they were sitting on them) and the ceiling.. It looked like they do not clean until the store closes. It was a bit.. disgusting.\n\nSecond, it's salty. VERY salty. Food was very oily too. The to-go box looked like a garbage can after it dried... I actually couldn't finish eating because it was too salty. I had to drink at least 1L of water after to remove that salty feeling on my tongue..."
1,Great food highly recommend this place to lots of friends. Everyone has enjoyed it so far. I wish they were open for lunch I would eat there more often!
0,Copoli Burger boasts that they have the best burger in Montr\u00e9al. This I'm no so sure about; it's doubtful. Their veggie burger is average but the portion is huge. The French fries are also average. I've had their pizza for some reason or an other and it is not very good at all. They have stale scones if you're into that. Only go here as a last ditch attempt at securing some food when all other options in the neighbourhood have been exhausted. Good luck.
0,Chicken and beef enchiladas and steak burrito were just average.  The spice really overwhelms any other flavors and the meats were low quality.
1,Super Great Food!!! The prices are not too shabby... My one flaw is the timelyness if your looking for a quick bite not the place or I suggest ordering before you come. (The food kinda takes a hot minute but it is worth it!!!) I've brought plenty of friends and they all love it. I also used them to cater my big 3-0!! Again everyone loved it!! Doesn't really matter what you order I've tried everything and it all agrees with my palate! Cheers!
1,Brings the taste of the islands here in AZ.  We have been eating here for several years and never had a bad meal.
1,"Came here for a free lunch at about 11am. There was both breakfast and lunch food available. No line to get in. Quick seating. Friendly staff. Huge pieces of tender and juicy prime rib, smooth and not too salty mashed potatoes, savory beef gravy, brussels sprouts, soft and creamy small cheesecakes for dessert. A really good meal. The only thing I missed was some shrimp as an appetizer."
1,I had a pleasant experience.  They were quick to find me a stylist (as I had no appointment) and the stylist took her time with my hair. I could not expect more; especially with a $5 price tag!!!
0,"I only had Pho so I can't judge the rest of the food, but the Pho was the worst I've ever had. Biggest let down ever, as I drove here once and it was closed and came back excited to get my fill of Pho at what's apparently the best place in Pittsburgh, but  left feeling sad. The broth tasted like water, and amount of beef and noodles you get was pathetic."
1,"If you live in Tempe you know there is no shortage of bars in our blazing college town. What happens when you graduate from college and walking across that stage to get your diploma also means you grow into a need for local hangouts where everybody still knows your name...just without the fight song sing-alongs and the floor so sticky you can't make it to the bathroom without losing a shoe? \n\nMac's Broiler & Tap is a quiet neighborhood hangout that still has that ever-present Tempe college spirit...for grown ups. Delicious bar food is abundant, beer is flowing from the tap, great daily specials and the service makes you feel right at home. \n\nI stopped by on a Saturday night and found it crowded with enough room to move around and enjoy the place. We easily found two seats at the bar at cozied up for a few drinks and some good conversation. Drinks are reasonably priced and you will nearly always be greeted by a stranger with a friendly hello. \n\nWhat may be it's strongest selling point is Mac's phenomenal location. In what may very well be one of the best corners in Tempe, Mac's is nestled in between one of the state's most amazing independent book sellers, Changing Hands and Trader Joe's grocery store. With so much going for it, make a day out of it!"
1,"First carwash I've been to that vacuum the trunk. Very honest about the service. My car is super clean. Totally worth my $30, tip included.\nThis will be my carwash from now on. \nI'll bring my older black exterior car here next time for the real test."
0,"*sigh*\n\n- do not sit at the bar for dinner\n- make sure the waiter listens to you and has the right order\n- pricey food\n\nWe sat at the bar since there was a long wait for the regular tables.\n\nStarted off with smoked chicken wings, asked for ranch - instead got blue cheese! The wings were alright, nothing to rave about.\n\nI love French baguettes! The bread that was given to us as a starter was warm and good.  The salted butter complimented well with the bread.\n\nPrime rib was actually mediocre. It had some flavor, but it just needed just a tad bit more. I loved the au jus more than the meat itself. It was a let down.\n\nOverall, I am not pressed to come back. The restaurant has a nice ambiance to bring friends to drink at the bar. The food, meh, I pass."
1,Everything=awesome!  Food was great as was the service and the ambiance! Strongly recommended if you like chicken especially.
1,"Creation is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. There are lots of things that are great, from the decor to the prices to the service...it's one of the places I come back to again and again, and I like to bring friends who are visiting from out of town here.\n\nMy favorite thing on the menu is the cabbage wraps with tofu. It's too much, which means I can bring some home. The half-price bottles of wine on Sundays are (obviously) an awesome asset as well. \n\nIt's a minimalist, warehouse kind of feeling inside. I love the big windows, the clean spaces, and the muted colors. The bar is nice as well, and it makes for a great escape from the Penguin's weekend frenzy if you want to be able to breathe and hear the folks you are with talking."

0,"\""buy, sell, trade...\""\n\n i always thought that buffalo exchange was where everyone gets there really trendy vintage clothes, which is what it is. but having to pay as much as you would if you were to go to a hole in the wall clothing store, isn't what you're asking for when going to a thrift/ \""hand-me-down\"" store. \n\ni went in intention to sell, i brought two bags. 1 garbage bag full jackets, dresses, and jeans, etc. and 1 garbage bag of fairly worn shoes. i waited an hour for them to check the 2 bags, only for them to take about 9 items. from what i remember.. they took an obey wallet, levi jeans, lace dress, 2 floral print dresses, members only jacket, olive green jacket, & a grey sequence top. it would have to be in good condition for potential buyers, because i remember hearing the employees fighting over a button missing or shoes being way worn out when in actuality they were only worn once.  \n\nthis review is mainly targeting to what i feel the styles of what they are looking for to buy... i truly feel that the clothes they are looking for are not garage-sale item clothing (of course), but more of the lines of vintage hip-hop/ sportswear & urban outfitters style. looking thru the racks of clothes, i noticed a lot of florals, prints, vintage sports wear, etc. \n\nof the 9 items that they took from me, they decide what they can sell that particular item for and if you chose to get cash back, you would receive 35% of what they can sell that item for. and if you agree to do a trade, you receive 50% of what they can sell that item for. the gentleman that was selling 1 pair of guess jeans received about $9 for 1 pair of GUESS jeans. they bought a vintage lacoste sweater (that i outgrew) from me that i only paid $3 for at savers, and when they were pricing the sweater, they were going to sell it for $25? i definitely have to agree with other reviews that they OVERprice items when people are obviously are getting rid of them."
1,"This is hands down my boyfriend and I's favorite spot in Chandler... Actually... ANYWHERE.  We absolutely LOVE San Tan Brewery and are there almost weekly.  I always joke with him saying that one day we will have our rehearsal dinner there.  I can not say one bad thing about this place.  I walk in and it seems like people recognize us, that's when you know things are good! \n\nSan Tan becomes more packed everytime I go in, but I love that they do so well!  They are very casual, loud, and a bar setting.  Don't walk in expecting to get a Bud Light, or Miller Light.  My fave beers are the Epicenter and Hefe.  I have ordered so many different food items off the menu but my recent fave is the Pork Pabil.. Its amazing.  \n\nYou will never go wrong with San Tan Fries... they are the best fries I have ever had.  All the servers are awesome, I have never had bad service from anyone there.  The bar tenders are great, and always make you feel like you are the only person at the bar.  This place is awesome for groups, or a casual date.  We bring out parents all the time and they love it just as much as we do."
0,"On standby with nothing better to do but vent my frustrations about an airline that is completely incompetent!  \n\nTo start, my ticket did not have my TSA precheck on it (despite having called and spoken to the us airways rep on the phone the day prior).  My husband had his number, but not mine. So much for my efforts to call and make sure that was taking care of....doesnt help if only ONE of us has pre check. \n\nA journey from oakland to san antonio took nine hours because both of our flights were delayed.  I was accepting because the afternoon flights are not always timely. I forgave and forgot. \n\nHOWEVER....for our 8:45 flight, we woke up early to be on time.  It was still dark as we left our san antonio hotel (which, was awesome. Highly recommend the Mokara Hotel in San Antonio).  Again, my TSA precheck is not on my ticket but after 15 minutes of confusion, the us airways rep FINALLY enabled that.  Fast lane at security so i can go hurry and wait ar the gate. \n\nThen, waiting. And more waiting. For an 8:45 am flight, our odds were more promising. Not so. For some reason, the plane was not ready until 15 minutes after our flight was supposed to leave. Once boarded, another 45 minutes goes by with an announcement from the pilot that the bags were now on the flight. Really?  An hour after the flight was to leave, the first flight of the day, and the bags just got on?!  So that was why we were an hour late?\n\nSo i registered my concern to the stewardess that if our flight was an hour late, we would miss our connecting.  Not much she could do she said.  Finally, we landed and ran to our gate (mind you, we are with our six year old) and get there on the nose.  The gate agent said they closed the doors and we could not get on. Perfect. \n\nSo now my family is waiting another 3.5 hours to catch an alternate plane on standby. We should have been home now.  \n\nI have posted to my facebook that i am forever boycotting this airline. And guess what? my friends are commenting how they have had similar experiences and will never fly us airways!  \n\nI can only hope that we get in this flight, it is not delayed and are bags reach our destination. I may be back to edit this review...\n\nSo i am back to report that after arriving home (finally), we discovered that both of our pieces of luggage were wet inside and out. All clothes had to be washed or dry cleaned. Unbelievable."
1,Very scary place with a lot of room on your credit card. Staff friendly and knowledgeable . Many brands and great sales tax for this Cali girl with a slight shoe addiction !
1,"This is truly the best Mexican food I've ever had--high quality dishes with fresh ingredients.  They served large portions at a ridiculously reasonable cost, and I've never had such good service from the staff there.  They went out of their way to serve me with style.  Even though I have family in. Charlotte, I might have to come back here just to come to Las Margaritas!"
0,"This was my worst experience at this location... This whole experience started bad from the beginning when we arrived. First off the valet was closed, not a big problem we will self park which is not close, you have to walk the miracle mile to get to the hotel.\n We arrive to check in and that took us standing an hour & a half in line before we said screw this were not gonna miss our show. We stepped out of the line and decided to leave our luggage at the concierge. \nHours later, We finally checked into the hotel and were given a crappy room that was 2 queens not 1 king like we had asked. There was a seat that had suspicious white stain on the arm.  The restroom was horrible, we had dirty towels, a running toilet bowl, the water in the shower did not drain and the mirror in front of the restroom was broken. \nSo ofcourse I call the front desk and was told they could not do anything for the night everything was booked up. I told them to please have the manager call me so I can speak to them personally. I was told he would give me a call later. \nSo next day rolls around and was moved to a better room with a better view, which was very nice. Again I asked if I can talk to the manager and was told he was in a meeting. \nNow we go to check out and I asked one last time to talk to the manager and again he was in a meeting. So we left a negative comment card and ask for them to contact us so we can share our bad experience...\n So screw this place they lost my business. I've had very great times here before but I will not return no mo. I do not leave negative reviews but this one had to be done. I have pictures to share. \n\nOh and incase your wondering I have not been contacted by management staff to this date. VERY PROFESSIONAL PLANET HOLLYWOOD!!!"
0,"I was here on business over the weekend and just had a mediocre experience. The block rate we got for the business was between $132 and $152 a night. \n\n+ Attached to the Forum Shops\n+ Registration staff was friendly\n+ Bell man Federico helped us out a LOT\n+ Cool fountains and decor\n+ Comfy beds\n+ Free Parking (as most hotels in Vegas have)\n\n- Our first room smelled moldy/rank\n- Got moved, but to a smaller room\n- Reception/Front Desk takes a WHILE to pick up\n- Housekeeping forgot to clean our room one day\n- There was calcium buildup on one of the sinks\n- Found out they only vacuum their floors (wear slippers because they're never formally cleaned!)\n- There was a CD player in our room, but no ipod hookup (I know this is minor, but who brings CDs with them to a hotel in Vegas?!)\n- Bell hop services charge $20 for a full cart, or $5 per box/piece for the convention center (a little steep for someone who is staying there)\n\nOverall, I think this place needs a massive facelift considering all of their new competition around them. Not sure if I'd pay that much to stay here."
1,"We just stopped in on a cold, but sunny morning, on our bicycles to warm up with a latte and muffin. Hadn't read the previous reviews, but our experience was good. The lattes were good and served promptly, and the pumpkin muffin was excellent. I will go back again."
0,"I love the concept of this restaurant and I was really excited to try it, the decor is cool and fun and the menu is interesting.  The service was friendly.  Kudos to someone who has a great idea and nuts up and goes through with it so I was glad to give them my business. \n\nThe two sandwiches I have had weren't all that great though, in a word greasy.  Now I love grilled cheeses and I have made some good ones myself and I load them up with butter and they get toasty, buttery, crispy, and gooey (AKA delicious).  Here it fell short and was limp and greasy.  The bread was barely toasted and I don't think they use butter but some type of oil instead.  The saut\u00e9ed mushrooms on one were grey and not brown and caramelized like they should be and they were also greasy too.  The cheese was barely melted so the sandwich wasn't held together by the melted cheese, a lot of the filling slipped out.  The salami I had in another sandwich was real low quality but worked out ok because it was soft and easy to bite.  \n\nIt really reminded me of the quality of some greasy diner and I had hopes for something more from the self proclaimed gourmet grilled cheese place.    \n\nIt is so true, with a simple thing like a grilled cheese the most important component is the execution and that was the biggest downfall."
1,"\""The little hippie food market that could\"" seems so out of place in the \""corridor of crap\"" that is Independence Boulevard, but I gotta tell 'ya this store is amazing for just about any special dietary need.\n\nThe star of this market is the aisle-long bulk foods section that puts anything at our other local grocery stores to shame.  Whether you need dried fruits, spices, or nuts or grains (even candies), I'm pretty sure they have it here, and also have it as an organic option.  You get as much as you need and then write the code on the side of the bag to be weighed at the checkout.\n\nThey also have just about every homeopathic remedy you could need too.  Again, you can get herbs by bulk or just about any nutrient/supplement your heart desires.  Big selection of incense and candles too.\n\nIf you have gluten allergies, this ought to be your go-to, they have a bigger selection than I have seen just about anywhere else.  Also, vegetarian/vegan friends will find a healthy supply and selection of different options here too.  They have a fresh produce section that is small, but can do in a pinch- same goes for fresh meats and frozen foods.  I'd still look elsewhere for regular shopping for these items, however.\n\nI have to deduct a start here because the store does get a little crowded-feeling and just has the appearance of being somewhat rundown (like most of its neighboring businesses) which is far below the standard at any of the other speciality grocers in town.  Still, the store is never loaded with people and the staff is most helpful if approached.  I still don't know why they put this store where it is, but I'm not going to complain because I'm glad it's there."
0,I really really wanted to like this place.  A friend showed me flier she recieved and it had some new breakfast items.  I was so excited.  I was not impressed with the atmosphere.  We ordered at the counter.  The prices were very high for as casual as it was.  We waited a long time for our drinks. I have to say if you give me a cup of coffee I dont mind waiting for food.  Or at least offer some water.  It was pricey for a cup of coffee that never got refilled so it was starbucks like and not resturant style.  We got our food.  The french toast was great.  The egg sandwhich was just that a egg sandwhich for 8.50 and I had to buy 2 cookies and another cup of coffee cause I was still hungry.  The very worst thing was the crepes.  They were sooooo hard and the raspberry sauce ruined the fruit.  They gave me a free cookie when I told them about the crepe.  They also asked if they could make me something else but I was leaving after waiting for such a long time waiting for our food.  I don't mind waiting if the food is good.  Can I please get some apple sauce as a side or something.  I don't know.  I love small places like this with good healthy options but I want to eat and feel good after spending 40.00.  Pink spakler drink was good. For as many people they had working there was not alot of service and not alot of food.
0,This is the absolute worst motel I have ever seen.  Was put up there by delta airlines as they had to cancel our flight.  I walked in the room to find a huge cockroach on the floor.  The room just smelled.  I didn't sleep all night.  Filthy!
1,Very good and very fresh food. I've been here a few times and the dishes are excellent. The customer service is also excellent. You're missing out if you like Thai food and you don't come here. I love supporting small business owners and the owner here is very nice. Great place!
0,"Poor and inconsistent service.   \n\nRates are high with requirements other rental companies dont have not to mention it was like they were doing me a favor for me to spend 600 bucks with them. \n\n Don't even try to rent if you use a debit card need everything from references, utility statements and first born. \n\nRecommend checking other rental agencies that appreciate return customers and more than likely have better rates."
0,"Worst company out there. I live in a community managed by ACM and it's a joke. They are rude and anytime you have a problem or complaint and call about it you will start getting letters saying that there are problems with our own property, in my case the letters were addressed to me but the pictures were of different properties not of mine. When I called to tell them it wasn't my house they treated me like I was lying. They've lost a money order I sent, and were never able to find it so I was out the payment and had to pay it again. I've lived in this community for years and our entire community is in agreement that we have the worst HOA management company ever. In fact the first time we ever received a \""community newsletter\"" from them was after our entire community received a letter from another home owner who wants to be voted onto the board so that we can find a new management company. In the 6 years prior we've only received our annual financial disclosure, meeting information, and plenty of \""violation alerts\"". I'm looking forward to having a better HOA management company, and I'm sure now that I've posted a review I'll get new violations for all sorts of imagined things, or problems on other properties, but that's ok. I'm getting smart about it and now keep a copy of everything I do and they do in return in a file marked HOA Management harassment so that my attorney can handle it. I'm just going to keep letting their harassments and incorrect violations and mistakes add up."
1,"Hilarious, hilarious, hilarious! One of the best comedy shows I've seen in Las Vegas, and I've been to the comedy club at Ballys and Tropicana several times. I got the tickets comped through showtickets4locals.com, so I was skeptical of the caliber of the show. However, my girlfriend and I were sidesplitting laughing the entire time! I would highly recommend for anyone who is looking for and affordable night comedy in Las Vegas."
1,"Jim 'N Nick's is a great chain BBQ place.  The atmosphere is nice and the people are friendly.  The BBQ meat and sides were satisfying accompaniments.  They have crushed ice.  What really made this place 4 stars in my book was the pie.  It is delicious.  You really can't beat a well made coconut cream pie or chocolate pie, and J'nN's really delivers.  Time for a nap!"
0,"over priced for the portion... So small. For 8.99 , the sweet n sour beef lunch special I had 7 small bite size pieces.. The flavor wasn't in the meat at all. There was only one other customer sitting at the bar. Got here around two pm on a Thursday. Quick to bring the food... But I will not be returning."
0,"Its a salad buffet....thats it! It's boring.  It's clean, good service, but its not exciting."
0,"If I could give zero stars, I would.  My team has been coming here after our hockey games for years- and I can count on one hand the times we've had a good experience.  The bartenders, with the exception of Zoe, are absolutely hands-down the most rude, nasty, incompetent bartenders in the city.  I've never been spoken to so poorly in my life- personally or professionally.  This place is a disgrace.  The management needs to make a serious overhaul in the attitude here.   Wake up guys- you're not the only bar in town.  Clean house- most of your bartenders are a joke.  Have Zoe, the best, train some new staff."
1,Big improvement over what was here before.  Lot's of fun play and great shops.
0,"So, judging from the rest of the reviews, I guess I caught them on a bad day.  A day bad enough for food poisoning.  I don't think I would return, even if it was free.  meh."
0,"WORST HOTEL EVER. \n\nIf there was a prostitute hotel. This would be it. \n\nThere was more problems with this hotel than working things. \n\nThe internet doesn't work, EVER. Thank GOD my phone has hotspot."
0,"Dropped in for a quick dinner.  The seating by the staff was rude and just herding cattle.  We sat down. .... had our silver ware when someone walked by and slammed two more sets down without saying a word.  Then we asked for bread , oh my the way NO BUTTER unless you request it.  . The .steak ordered appeared to have been grilled and then microwaved on a plate.  The waiter then asks how every thing is.  Wrong question.  He became confrontational AND offered to have the chef speak to us.  Then the manager is brought into the fray. His response. .... go to the corporate website and tell them.  These was the worst meal out in a long long long time.  Do yourself s favor pay attention to yelp. ... do not spend your money or time in this place. ...disgusting"
1,"If you're new to the Valley and have absolutely no idea what grows here, come to Baker's.\n\nIf you've lived a long time here, know what doesn't shrivel to a dead dry crisp as soon as the thermometer hits 100 and are looking for plants and shrubs and trees, come to Baker's. \n\nIf you're just really, really into flora, come to Baker's. \n\nSometimes, hubby and I just drive over to spend a couple hours nosing around all the great stuff here--like roses, garden ornaments [not just plants], herbs, and lots of useful advice. All the folks who work here know their stuff and have probably been working here since they were kids themselves. We've even purchased an apple tree that thrives in Phoenix and produces little apples from Baker's!!\n\nSo green up your thumb and get yer yard stuff here."
0,"We've been here twice and the manager, some big blonde lady sits at the bar and chatters loudly on her phone drinking white wine the whole time.  The food and service was so so, nothing to come back to, especially since Grimaldis is down the street.  Every time we pass this place we have a little chuckle, the lady one time kept yelling at her phone, \""WHAT!\"" \""NO!\"", \""WHAT!\"", \""NO!\"", how annoying is that when you are trying to enjoy dinner.  Pass this place over, too bad I like little Italian joints.  Get it together!"
0,"The decor of Beijing Noodle No. 9 is awesome but like most Vegas' places that's all there is to it for what they charge... eh-hem overpriced meals. I came here for a work lunch as everywhere else had a 30 minute wait. Ordered an ice tea, not bad, and then the beef chow fun. The beef chow fun was not bad, kind of greasy and the beef was overcooked. Noodles are made fresh in house so thumbs up. Service left little to be desired and even though I did not pay for the meal I wouldn't come back."
1,Very good bagels and sandwiches!
0,"When I first heard there was a retro arcade in a bar, I was totally down. Sadly, that joy was gone way too fast. \n\nThe adventure started at the bar, where I was served an average drink in a plastic cup. After finishing the my drink, I decided to play a few games. So, I found the neared change machine to get the gaming started. Sadly, all the games are at least 50 cents, and half of the games I tried to play, just took my money. When I asked the bar tender how to get my money back, he simply said, \""We're working on it and don't play that game anymore.\"" Thanks buddy.\n\nAfter that, we finished our drinks and headed to the next spot. \n\nOn a side note. If you want table service, you get a PS3/XBOX to play the whole night. At least you'll get to play a game. But the display is mirrored, so everyone in the bar can watch you play too."
0,"I really didn't know what I was getting myself into. But I stayed about 15 mins before calling it a night.\n\nNot a huge rock fan and if I wanted to watch women shake their moneymakers about, I could have easily gone to my room mirror and jiggle my jello for free.\n\nI need something with guys. Lots and lots of guys. I think I'll go to the Chippendales show at Rio next time."
0,"I wanted to love this restaurant from the moment I walked in.  A Sunday brunch with friends let me experience the ambiance, delicious food, great pastries (thanks Amelie's), and rocking bloody mary's.  From this description alone you'd expect a 5 star rating, but with this restaurant it's the service which destroys it.  It often times feels like you're playing Russian Roulette with a 4 bullets loaded.  I just don't understand it.\n\nThe first time we went it was magical.  The second time we went (also with another couple) the service began to show its wear and tear.  All the other times were a toss up between amazing and atrocious with no indicators to give you advance warning.\n\nThe last straw for me came after a very difficult day in which my wife and I were hoping Cafe Monet could turn it around.  From the first impression we could tell the waitress would rather be having a root canal than take our order.  This wasn't the first time we'd encountered that look in Cafe Monte, but with an almost empty restaurant (we went in early) you think she'd want to milk every ounce of tip she could\n\nAttitude dripped from her monologue and our lack of alcoholic drink orders brought a sigh to her lips.  All I wanted, nay... craved, was a chocolate croissant and an almond croissant warmed up.  This was the text book definition of a SIMPLE order.  I'll give you a second to figure out what happened next.\n\nShe screwed it up.  She gave me a chocolate croissant and then an almond chocolate croissant.  She didn't care less about the screw up.  After tasting the incorrect almond croissant I asked for the correct one to be brought out.  She snagged the plate and then disappeared.  Actually, most of the time she was disappeared which is an amazing feat for an empty restaurant.\n\nWhen the correct croissant finally came out it was cold.  C'mon.... seriously?  I asked for it heated up and received barely lukewarm.  Suffice it say, my tip reflected her total lack of caring.  I'm done with this place.  If I want French I'll go to Georges Brasserie and if I want pastries then I'll go to Amelie's."
1,GREAT seats for VIVA ELVIS!!! THANKS so much!!!
1,So prefer this over the super center on decatur. Ready to navigate and well laid out.
1,"Been here 2 times. \n\n2k10 Popped my xS cherry. Love it! great atmosphere, saw Holly Madison, Amare Stoudamire, Kevin Durant, and JaMarcus Russell poppin champagne.\n\n2k11 Popped it again for my 25th bday. Got fully hooked up from girlfriend's friend who is vegas promoter/knows the owner of xs so we got the full VIP treatment from bottle service, table, and got to chill next to Ne-Yo who gave me props for being so pimp cause my girl was wearing heals that made her taller than i was and thought i was picking up on a random chick being a certified cat williams pimp, smh. Only thing that threw me off about this visit was they played nothing but house/trance music. NO THANKS!\n\nOverall i love the club, atmosphere and best part it doesn't get too sweaty hot unlike TAO"
1,We always love the patio seating. The food is always fresh and good. Never had a bad experience with the staff or food at all. We come every now then for lunch.
0,I've been to Max's many times over the years. I've always had their club sandwich which never disappointed me. Last Friday my wife and I tried the fish fry and we were very disappointed! We received one and a half pieces of fish. Who ever heard of half a piece? The fish wasn't that great either and the cole slaw was even worse! Last time for us!!!  :-(
1,"This is one of our favorite sandwich spots because of the bread and tasty ingredients!\n\nWe are at Palms Hotel and Casino quite often as we see a lot of movies at their movie theater so of course we stop here for a nice treat.\n\nOur latest visit my boyfriend decided on the cannonball which is meatballs, cheese and marinara and I got the tuna melt! I like that they use albacore tuna for this sandwich as it makes a big difference as I prefer Albacore at all cost. This is one of the most tasty tuna melts I have had and I am already craving my next visit to enjoy this sandwich again.\n\nThe bread and the very good ingredients is what makes their sandwiches a hit with so many of us EOS fans!\n\nI have tried many of their Signature sandwiches such as the Hawaiian, cannonball, turkey and cheese, tuna melt, chipotle chicken avocado, The Original and the turkey dinner sandwich they featured for a limited time in November that was a winner! It was not as good as the famous Bobby at Capriotti's however it hit the spot. \n\nThe last two visits we made we used our buy one get one free coupon from the 2013' Entertainment guide. I was so happy and shocked when I saw them listed in the book so that meant two free sandwiches for us, awww yeah!\n\nMy boyfriend and I will be back many times over to enjoy a sandwich and their yummy brownies!"
0,"Opens at 6 am. Not busy and everything looked and smelled fresh.\n\nOne morning we decided to just stay in and relax.  So, the morning called for a couple of bagels.  Everything Bagel, Cinnamon Raisin Bagel and Halla bagel.  I drove the few miles and walked in really early.  There was no one in line and I was immediately helped.  I made my order from one employee, paid another and received my bagel from yet another.  So, there was obviously some sort of miscommunication as they gave me a wrong bagel.  I know it's not the end of the world but I just wanted to bring it to attention.  So, that is why I gave it 2 stars.  I'm sure I'll be back sometime."
1,"I go to two locations regularly and this location always has the friendliest people working, looks clean, and has a great variety of classes. It doesn't seem as closed in or dark as some of the other locations. No complaints :) The women at the front desk on the evenings I go always seems to be wiping down the doors, windows, desk etc. Which when you consider all the sweating on the machines it is nice to at least have the illusion that everything is being cleaned all the time!"
1,"I had dinner here last weekend, and decided to order the gnocchi since I had it at Bouchon in Yountville.  I thought it was either overcooked and or dry, so sent it back for another order since it was what I came here for.  The next order wasn't much better, and the waitress and manager apologized and comped me my dinner.  Even though I didn't like my food, I still give them 3 1/2 stars for trying to make it right and apologizing.  The other thing that was annoying was that we ordered bottled water, and they took it away from the table to keep it on ice.  Well the busboy or expediter kept coming over and pouring tap water from a pitcher into our glasses.  The waitress had to keep coming over and tell the busboy not too do that.The atmosphere is pleasant and my wife liked her mussels.  I will have to go back to Yountville to see if my taste buds were correct.  They insist that it is the same recipe."
0,"I am pretty sure my friends and I stumbled into a coke party when we came here for a late bite after a house show back in the Neighborhood.\n\nThe lights were low, there were people dry humping each other wall-to-wall, and lots of frequent, quick trips in and out of the bathrooms by staff and guests alike.\n\nAll to a soundtrack of terrible techno.\n\nAll of this would've been worth a laugh if it weren't for the food.  We ordered a vegan pizza, a couple cheese slices, and an order of garlic knots.\n\nThe vegan pizza was a barely-cooked pie with hummus haphazardly smeared across it.  The worst part about it was the paprika - they had attempted to season the hummus, but for some reason, rather than sprinkling the spices across the entire pie, there were 5 distinct, huge mounds of paprika that spotted the pie like an outbreak of chickenpox.\n\nThe slices came out first, and were cold even before we reminded them that we ordered garlic knots - which took an unholy 20 mintues, after we reminded them.\n\nTo top it all off - the garlic knots, those of the epic cooking time, were completely cold and raw in the middle.\n\nEddie's pizza is like some bizarre circle of hell."
1,"I read a reveiw below that someone blamed Home Plate for getting sick.  Sorry lady but the onset for almost ALL foodborne illnesesses is at LEAST 24 hours, so it wasnt your breakfast. Before you bash someone publicly, educate yourself on the possibilites of why you may be sick.  \n\n I eat here often.  No place is perfect, but all in all Home Plate is Family freindly and good food and affordable food.  GREAT place for sports\nI have eaten there 20 plus times and always consistent.  I had 1 issue with slow service and some chicken wings but managemnet was rt on top of it.  I am going there tonight with Friends and kids.  FYI...garlic knots need more flavor....a little more salt in the dough maybeL:)"
0,Do not eat here. Terrible.
0,not the best for family dining and man was it not worth it! I am a huge fan of Elmer's Tacos (right down the street) and thought I would give Guedo's a try for once. MISTAKE. What kind of a place doesn't take CC's?  Disappointing to say the least. Food was below average and the lack of service and smiles really annoyed me.
0,"If you want your waiters harassing you and begging you for their tips all night then this is the place to be.  My co-workers and I went there on a Tues for the \""ladies night free drinking\"" and every time our waiter would come around and we wanted to place an order she would tell us, Ok i'll take care of you if you take care of me, EVERY SINGLE time for at least 3 times in a row.  We finally got a manager & all he did was apologize.   The waiter which btw her name is ROBYN purposely kept bumping us and even made my friend spill a drink on me because she pushed her as we were walking by (we figured we would just get our drinks from the bar now) and did the same thing to a couple of my other friends as well.  We asked her a few times what her problem was but ignored us and walked away.  Well, next thing you know Security asked us to leave because WE were harassing their staff!!! They were obviously on her side and they DO NOT care about their customers.  They said they watched the 'tape' were we were harassing her. When we asked them to watch the videos when SHE pushed us they said they didn't have time to watch a 2hr tape, yea it obviously wasn't convenient for them.  So as we are outside discussing the whole issue Security kicks out this drunk guy and literally drop him on the pavement, it was so loud you'd hear him when he hit.  Then as the poor drunk unconscious guy tries to stand up they start BEATING him up very badly!! I felt So bad for him because he's not sober, there was no need to beat him up outside after the fact they had already kicked him out.  This place is TERRIBLE worst nightmare ever, will never return, they don't care about their customers."
0,"Let's just keep it short - AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!!!  I could bore you with all the details but just take my word for it, if you have a problem after the purchase don't bother talking to the condescending manager he'll just frustrate you more.  Just go to one of the other 1000's of jewelry stores within 20 miles."
0,I had the number 12 to go. I was disappointed with this dish. It was greasy and had too much cheese. It was also fairly bland.
0,Way overpriced food which isn't an authentic Mexican restaurant. Mexican food is one of my favorite cuisines but this restaurant didn't deliver. Food is ok but won't recommend it.
0,"Meh is about right. This store is basically the same as the Smith's just up the street, only with higher prices and not as much selection. I come from California where everything is a ripoff ... and the prices here are just as bad if not worse. I don't remember it always being that way, but that's the way it is now. \n\nOh well. It's not like there aren't a ton of other grocery stores within a 90-second drive."
0,Worst manicurist ever. Came here to pamper myself on my birthday. I told the woman on the phone that I wanted to make sure that I got a massage with my pedicure. She said that massage was included. I signed up the deluxe pedicure and had the unfortunate luck to get Jimmy.  Both people next to me had longer times in the chair and they were there before me. He rushed through the massage and did not seem to know what he was doing. These sage I did get was rough and my  back kept hitting the back not the chair. His nails needed cutting as they cut into the bottoms if my feet. I had to wait 15 even though I had an appointment and was out witching 1/2 hour. When I complained the reduced the price by $5. Big deal. What should have been a relaxing time was annoying. My advice is to find a different salon that cares for customer  service.
0,"This place was highly recommended by our friends and we were hoping to also like it. First off, I called and asked if I could bring a small birthday cake for my husband's birthday. The lady on the phone said it was not an issue. We got there and it was packed on a Friday night. The hostess said it would be 20 minutes for a table. Literally two seconds later, there was a four person table cleared. I asked for the table and she got someone to clean it for us. The place was busy and noisy.  The menu was limited and average priced for most items. I craved noodles so ordered the Pad-Seiw. The noodles were alright. Somehow seems like there should be basil in the dish and not a bunch of cauliflower. The hubby had the bbq chicken with coconut rice.  Later our server later came back to tell us that they were going to charge us 5 dollars for bringing our own cake. Nice how that was not mentioned on the phone or when she first took the cake to the fridge for us.  So sadly we will not be returning. Thai Rama has much better food and service."
1,"A birthday trip for my boyfriend turned into an elopement.\nAfter six years and a few cocktails we decided, fuck it let's get married. We put our destination wedding plans on the back burner and did it just for us.\n   I found LWWC, we needed cheapish ceremony since we lived the past 4 days up Vegas style. You'd be surprised to know how much it costs to have Elvis marry you anywhere in Vegas. The whole process was painless and super easy. I didn't want to rent a cheap dress,  photographer or flowers. H&M and Gucci(something blue) was just fine for me, the ceremony was about $50. \n I was worried the officiant would be very generic, creepy ect.....Pastor Chris was AMAZING!! Very personal and genuine. He really made the moment special, yes they have a recommended tip, but he was totally worth it.\n    The chapel space itself is very dated and kitchy. Since our friends were going to be our witnesses/photographers we had to do it in the courtyard which was totally fine. Don't forget to pose with the pink Cadillac.\n     Great for a quickie wedding. I wouldn't expect elegance, sophistication  and glamour it's Vegas after all."

1,"I give them 5 stars for their burgers but have to give em 3 for their fries.. It's nice but not AMAZING in my opinion. I'm definitely coming  here again and would highly recommend it. The patties are half an inch thick and it's nice that you can specify how you want the patty cooked. \n\nCash Only! So be prepared or use the arm inside. \n\nThere's parking available but DONT wonder off the premises and keep your car in their lot it will get towed. \n\nFriendly service and while the line may seem long at first it moved really fast. The inside interior is cute and simple, a little rustic even. I like the outdoor seating area where you are sitting in giant piece of rounded wood - I forget the name heheh ..\nAnyways come here and get a double patty, if you're not super hungry and don't have a giant appetite get a double \""little one\"" otherwise get the BIG ONE.. And I got a double little one w cheddar cheesex2 but my next visit will be one cheddar slice and one Swiss - nice balance I think."

0,"After months of avoiding Los Dos Molinos in favor of places with better service and margaritas, we decided to return last Saturday night and give the place another chance. We were actually even less impressed with the experience than last time. \n\nMy blue corn enchiladas were still quite good, but my husband's chimichanga was just average. I guarantee you that you can get a better chimichanga for half the price at many of the other great Mexican restaurants in South Phoenix. The accompanying rice was also really dry; I think the rice at Poncho's is a lot better. \n\nI also gave the tequila-flavored limeade--I mean, margaritas--another chance, but was still completely disgusted by them. The most amusing part is that after I told the server that I found them to be too limey and sweet last time, he admitted that they mix the margaritas up in advance and that if the server doesn't properly \""stir\"" the mix, they can be \""too sweet.\"" He then promised me that it would be \""better this time.\"" I guess I'm a sucker for ordering one anyway (I guess I had this morbid desire to see if it was really going to be as bad as last time), but shame on Los Dos Molinos for approaching margarita-making like they're serving drinks at a college party. \n\nFinally, the service is totally pretentious for no reason. I understand that this restaurant is very popular, but I don't feel that the owners take much pride in putting out consistently good-quality food and drinks or in being a place where people feel comfortable and want to linger with friends. \n\nLos Dos Molinos must always be so busy because people are lured by the exotic spiciness (and maybe falsely equate spiciness with authenticity), but I have a feeling that discerning restaurant-goers who notice (and care about) the details might not be in love with the place."
1,"I enjoyed our three stays at this hotel at this hotel and casino. I agree with the customers that complain about the courtyard rooms. Though the room my husband and I were not as disgusting as described, just a worn carpeting. The bathroom and everything else was fine, and we had a pleasant stay. The last two stays have been fantastic. We were in the tower and had beautiful rooms! The one on the last stay was huge, with a fantastic view and almost like a honeymoon suite! The employees were helpful and we were both pleased with our requests with all the staff. The cleaning ladies were always very nice, as well as the servers, and card dealers.I liked the buffet because I have stomach issues,  and this is one of the few places I can eat without being in agony. I hope in the future they choose to upgrade the courtrooms. But the tower is lovely. No complaints here."
0,"Overhyped by yelpers.\n\nThe pork tenderlion that was higly recommended by yelpers relied too much on the sauce (which was too sweet), once the sauce was gone, I had no motive to finish the rest.\n\nAnd the spicy red sauce they used in most of their dishes tasted like Sriracha sauce straight from the supermarket.\n\nService was decent and seating was cramped. Not recommended if you are bringing a date."
0,"TERRIBLE customer service. As I was in line, other customers and I watched the desk person have a conversation with someone who seemed to be a co worker. The people behind me said they had seen her put her hand up so I went up to the counter. She continued talking so I waited. The coworker directed the counter persons attention to me. She replied to her coworker that she had not called me up. I asked if she wanted me to wait or go back in line. She instructed me to go back in line. As soon as I got back to the waiting point, she yelled, next in line! Absolutely atrocious! I will appeal to my employer to use a different airline from now on since their baggage fees make up for or exceed the other airline's fares. I am done with Spirit. Not the first issue I have had with them, but it WILL be the last!"
1,"Stephanie was awesome! On time, professional, and friendly. My makeup lasted all day for my engagement pics and it was exactly how I wanted it. My fianc\u00e9 was even impressed. Excited to post some pictures once I get them from our photographer."
1,"I had family in town during restaurant week and my mom suggested we try Malabar because the menu for restaurant week provided a lot of choices. \nEverything we ate was delicious. In particular the croquetas and gambas al ajillo from the tapas menu were bigger than I expected. \nFor entrees our party of 4 tried 3 of the 5 offerings: Suquet de Mariscos, Albondigas con arroz, Mixed grill. Everything was delicious. The rice almost out-shined the albondigas. Definitely inspired me to return to try their paella. \nDesserts were good- light but sweet- however, definitely not as memorable as the tapas and platos. \nMusic was not too loud and well-selected, playing one of my favorites from Barcelona, who had just been to CLT recently, Jarabe de Palo. \nBeer selection also included a little taste of Catalu\u00f1a including the more difficult to find in the States, Estrella Damm. \nTo sum up, the food and drinks (including an affordable wine selection by glass) would definitely bring me back for a second try. \nMy only negative, which may speak more to restaurant week than to Malabar, was that I did feel rushed. There definitely wasn't \""sobremesa\"" time. The wait staff was attentive, maybe overly so. At one point the waitress tried to take my plate with my pan con tomate (which we ordered extra off the regular menu and was worth it) even before I was finished and my sangria glass when I still had some left in my glass. Not huge criticisms, but for me, one of the best parts of Spanish eating- besides the flavors- is the sharing and relaxing over delicious food without worry for time or pace. \nOverall it was a great meal."
1,"I was initially a bit skeptical about coming here because 1) there were bad reviews and 2)  they were doing a groupon sale.  I know my second reason may sound weird to some of you but businesses promote their business on groupon normally when they're struggling, which may be a result of poor service.\n\nSo I contacted them to ask them if their groupon deal was applicable to any day since it was a \""now\"" deal at the time. But the man who answered, Joe, told me that I don't need to purchase it online through groupon and that I just come in and tell him my name and look for him so that he can honor the deal regardless of whether I purchase the deal or not.\n\nSo I made my way there which is in the gas station at the intersection of Sahara and Durango. A bit far from where I live and work but most places around me were going to charge me $35-70 for the same service so I made the trip here. \n\nAs soon as I arrived, my car was immediately attended to and it took about 35-40 minutes to do which was standard and efficient to me. Really liked the service and I'm proud of taking a gamble regardless of its low Yelp ratings. Joe, whom I assume is the manager, was very courteous and professional. I definitely can't ask for more. For my reminder sticker, they listed $3 off for my next visit, which I assume is not combined with the groupon deal.\n\nOverall, very satisfied with my experience here."
1,Tacos are Great!!! Love the pozole it is very very  delicious and I also enjoy the torta ahogada with the salsa picosa that is served on the side.
1,"Lot of bad reviews here.  I guess my experiences, yup that's plural, was different.  As an Asian, I always look for the hot long noodle soup.  Vegas is heaven for that reason, and this place inside the Monte Carlo has the best soup.  You get a large bowl, but the quality is what sold me.  The broth was delicious.  The noodles were chewy goodness.  Bok Choy and Won Tons perfect.  And I always add in the Crispy Duck.  Great flavor.  I always get good service, so maybe I was lucky.  But again, I've been here multiple times and will come back multiple times."
1,Great stone crabs in dinner buffet. Great selection. Great apple cooler. Try the salmon. Bad pasta and pizza. Bad sushi.
1,"The best burger joint in the whole country, I ordered the damnation chicken burger with chocolate smoothie, I did not have any burger taste in my mouth like that. the Parmesan truffle fries. it is pricey but it's worth it. I tried Jack in the Box and Sonic but nothing like Gordon Ramsay burger. his a tip for two people to order your own burger and drink and share order of fries."
1,"Recently joined the YMCA and this is my \""home\"" ymca.  I LOVE the equipment and 'most' of the staff.  I have hit the gym (been a member about 30 days) at very varied times but have settled on 5 am for strength training (mon/wed/fri) and 3pm (ish) for cardio (Tues/Thurs/Sat).  At either time it isn't overwhelmingly crowded.\n\nI will say at 5 am (and I assume other times) there are plenty of meat heads in the weight room - grunting, slamming weights, flexing in the mirror.  I also  find it entertaining to see the fashion show that occurs in the weight room (I like to ppl watch between sets).   I have NEVER seen so many coordinated work clothes in my entire life.  Matching shows, pants/shorts/shirts and often times hats.  None of this bothers me, it is just entertaining.\n\nI have not met anyone very friendly there and I assume that is because it is the \""SoPark\"" area - but since I don't go to the gym to socialize I guess it doesn't matter."
0,"This place is a terrible value.  For $9 my burrito better be good, huge or both.  At La Loma it was neither.  There is no kids menu so I even over paid for my children.  Top it all off with an order at the counter and eat off Styrofoam experience and there's no reason to go back.\n\nI really liked the owner's old place, Arturo's, but La Loma has none of Arturo's great qualities.  We knew we had to try La Loma, now that we have, we'll never go back."
0,"The worst Salmon I've ever had. The service was garbage. The restaurant was dirty and again... the worst Salmon I've ever had. I've been to my share of Hard Rock Cafe's so, for food, service, cleanliness.. I'll have to give two thumbs down in a 360 rotation."
1,"I took my phone out while walking around. \""No photography in the store, hun,\"" to which I replied that I was not. \""I know, sweetheart, I'm just sayin', there's no photography in the store, honey.\"" \n\nIt's hard enough being a woman that can fix her own car stuff. Being called pet names by strange women does not help. \n\nI contacted corporate and told them that the whole experience made me feel very uncomfortable. \n\nThis is where the obviously one star review turns into a five star review. The general manager was awesome in apologizing and assured me that she would receive some coaching on subtlety and proper behavior.\n\nThat really makes up for it. My greatest fear was that it was a given that if you're a woman in Autozone you're going to encounter condescending employees. I really felt like he was concerned and wanted that to not be the case.\n\nThanks for caring, AutoZone!"
0,The old guy cut my cuticle when he was doing my nails. They are old and rude. They old ass need to retire. He kept making jokes and laughing. Ill never go back there again. This is my first review. U shouldn't bleed when getting your toes done. Wtf.
0,I was not impressed! I had Greek salad and moussaka and another pasta dish together! The salad had no flavor like they forgot something in the dressing! The food was plentiful but tasteless! My husband had gyro he's had the real thing in Greece and he said it was just okay! I don't know if we will return unless we hope to try something else with the hopes that it might be better than what we had! When we walked in did not know if we should sit or order at counter no one greeted us so my husband had to find someone in back to ask!
0,"Food is nicely presented, tapas style, but really nothing remarkable.  If you don't go to dinner often, you would be impressed by the presentation and the fancy cocktails--which were very small and way too expensive for what you got.  Even the entrees (served a little bigger than tapas size) were nothing great.  Many better ethnic restaurants in the city!  Atmosphere is hip and trendy.  Dress to impress!"
0,"My husband and I made dinner reservations for Gordon Ramsay's Pub with high expectations.  My God, after watching KN & HK, you'd expect nothing but the best.  Unfortunately, we were sadly disappointed.  We were there at 6:00 on a Monday night for dinner.  The place was nearly empty.  So whom do they sit next to us, when there are dozens of open seats everywhere?  A table of 4 loud drunks.  The server came up to us immediately, but that was the high point of the evening.\n\nWe ordered fish & chips and prime rib, both of which also came to us immediately.  My fish was cold, my fries were cold and greasy, my husband's prime rib was nothing special.  His vegetables were cold and mushy; his mashed potatoes cold and tasteless.  When we questioned the server, he said that the fish & chips were made \""only\"" 5-10 minutes before our order.  If he admits to 5-10 minutes, I bet on at least 30.  I thought that Gordon's restaurants always made dinners to order -- at least something as traditional and simple as fish & chips.  How can you screw that up?\n\nBesides that, the place just doesn't feel and look clean.  The silverware is put right on the table, which in our case was covered with sprinkled salt, a sure sign that the table had not been cleaned between diners.  The uniforms of the servers were wrinkled and mismatched.  I'm not sure what look Gordon was seeking, but the servers clearly do not have the same \""vision\"".\n\nWhen we complained to the manager, he was dismissive and condescending, making sure to inform us that \""Gordon had just been there last week and everything was great\"".  Well maybe great when the boss is around, but with zero or no quality standards when he is not.\n\nBottom Line: Save your money for fish fries at your local Catholic church during Lent.  Gordon's made enough money from hard-working \""no counts\"" like us."
0,"I would not return without strong coaxing. The food was nothing special. We ordered one of the skillets. I can't remember the name but it was the only one with feta cheese. Maybe my expectations were off but, when I have ordered skillets at other restaurants, the ingredients were integrated. At The Griddle, each item (scrambled eggs, potatoes, chicken and feta cheese) appeared to be cooked, placed on the iron skillet separately and then served. Additionally, the chicken was dry. The waitress also did not charge us the correct price for egg whites but, my friend did not want to address this as it was only a $1 over what it should have been.\n\nI ordered the French toast as I heard The Griddle on Eastern was known for their French toast. The portion was a good size and they tasted fine. Not wonderful and not bad but, they would not bring me back to this restaurant over another place."
0,"good service from the staff.  the food looked good, but some didn't taste so good.  the oysters were fishy.  the duck too undercooked.  the white truffle ricotta so so, the mosaic froie gras was so so, but the bill was toooo much.  the food does not warrant a return visit."
1,"This place is great! I don't know what they put in those ass juice shots but they aren't wrong with the \""happiest place on earth\"" sign out front! Also for only $3 you can pile your friends in a photo booth by the bar to get some memories of the evening."
1,"Nothing beats a chocolate devotions ice cream on a HOT SUMMER DAY in AZ. Its the combination of the chocolate ice cream with choco chips, brownies and fudge and served with chocolate covered almonds waffle that make is SOOOO GOOD! I won't say no for an ice cream in 100 degrees weather like we are having right now. Really is a guilty pleasures!\n\nAlthough the ice cream was very good, they need to put a sign for the location though. It was hard to find this place and I had to drive all around the Fry's just to look for it. It was hidden in the very end of the South side of Fry's."
1,Very unique and quite delicious food! We have tried several different entrees and they all are fantastic! Crab Rangoon's are a must here!
1,"Stayed here on my most recent Vegas trip and loved it. It's affordable and while it does have a gimmicky feel, it still feels chic unlike some of the other themed hotel-casinos on the strip. The pyramid gives the room a unique and spacious feel, and while a couple of pieces in the room are in need of updating overall it feels modern and clean. Had no issues with the staff, check-in, wifi, and enjoyed the nice flatscreen TV in the room. Would stay here again!\n\nPS- play myVegas on Facebook for access to cheaper rooms. After just a few hours I was able to get the weekend rate to $65. Do it, and embrace the MLife!"
0,I generally love Lucky Lous but they have been really hit or miss lately. Just got 3 chicken tenders the size of my thumb and they dont appear to be hand battered like normal... whats going on? Used to be amazed by how good these tenders were but this is pretty disappointing.
0,"Arizona Charlie's was recommended to us by family who live in Vegas. We came for their wedding, and they told us this place was a good deal. This was how I learned we were the black sheep of the family, because there is no way I would tell even my worst enemy to ever step foot in this place.\nEvery casino/hotel in Vegas has a smoky atmosphere, but in this place you can feel the gritty cigarette smoke that hangs in the unfiltered air. The front desk staff are apathetic if not necessarily rude. You have to give your room key to security before you can get into the elevator, not because they are so up-scale as to offer added security but because only psychopaths and desperate people come here, and desperate people will probably try to break into your room at some point to steal whatever they can get their hands on.\nThe beds were uncomfortable but the rooms were clean at least. My requested wake-up call came through, even though when I called at 2 a.m. to request a 6 a.m. wake-up call the operator laughed at me like I was insane, which I was not to pack up and leave the moment our taxi first pulled up to this hell-hole.\nA word on the food, which everyone points to as the reason to ever come here: the buffet is horrendous, don't do it. The cafe has a great burger and fries special with your player's club card (you don't actually have to play, the card is free) for about 2 dollars; at 3 in the morning you can take all your siblings and their kids to the cafe for the 3.99 ham and eggs (one players card for every 4 people will ensure everyone gets this rockin' deal) and no one will leave hungry, though the potatoes were cold once and the ham is salty. Still, I think I'd rather have paid a lot more for food and stayed someplace where I wasn't worried about what I would catch walking down the hall to my room.\nAll in all, I will never forgive my family for suggesting this place, and I actually may never go back to Vegas, because all the glitz and glamour in the world will not be able to erase the traumatic memories I have of that city now. Thanks a lot, Arizona Charlie's. \nOh, but if I do go back, I will take full advantage of the free drinks cocktail waitresses bring you when you are sitting at a machine, not even playing but just waiting for the rest of your party to come down so you can leave. Free pina coladas at 8 in the morning is the only way I made it through this weekend."
0,"I came here many years ago and used to love it. My family and I came here recently and the meat was TOO salty. We thought it was a one time thing and decided to go again, and again the meat was too salty and two of us got sick. \nWhatever you guys did, change it back!!!"
1,"I enjoyed. Would have enjoyed even more had they had mimosas lol - but that's just me tho. Very friendly server, food was really good. I'll be back."
0,"This place falls under the category \""Want to like but disappointing.\"" A local brew pub in the Atwood neighborhood is a great idea.  When i heard it was opening I was pumped! It's just unfortunate that the product is average tasting overpriced beer with similarly overpriced subpar food in an echoey cinderblock building with mediocre service.\n\nI've had a few sandwiches on the menu. 1 is worth the double digit price.  The sassy bird is good but every other sandwich tastes like it's missing something. Their beer is OK. IF you were to find a beer you liked enough to buy a pitcher, you couldn't because you can only buy by the pint.\n\nService is spotty. Ive been here a few times and the service has varied.  One waiter was incredibly unhelpful. On another visit i asked if the red ale was hoppy the bartender replied \""No, it's very malty.\"" It was hoppy as hell! I then asked the bartender if this was the correct beer because of said hoppyness. She replied, \""It takes hops to make beer of course it going to be hoppy.\"" She lost my respect and 10% of the tip i was going to give.  I then politely asked for a water and flagged down a different bartender who pointed me towards the brown ale. \n\nAll in all I guess an average brewpub is better than a vacant lot. The bar still echoes like a vacant building though..."
0,Old fish = sick. \n\nCan someone explain this to the people here? Please. Twice this horrible pain and bloating within 30 minutes of lunch. Twice. Run for your life!
0,"terrible service. the brunch fondue looked intriguing so we asked the waiter about the serving size. the menu claimed it'd accomodate 2 people but we wanted to make sure. the waiter said, 'you can add some vegetables and it should be ok.' so we agreed to that.\n\nhe rarely came back out to help us the entire time. then when we got the bill, he charged us for *2* fondues. i went in and disputed the charge and he finally credited us for one of them. however, after keeping track of the credit card statement, it appears that he never refunded the fondues.\n\nthis is still in dispute and i want to make sure you no one makes the mistake of going here.\n\nps - panera's food is better than this and i don't even like panera."
1,Loved the breakfast! Protein Berry Pancakes and eggs!
0,I used to come here for happy hr . They had a lot to choose from and a GREAT bartender . Went recently and was disappointed . Food menu is tiny and no vegetarian options. Drink selection also small if you're not a bourbon/whiskey/rye drinker your out of luck . I know they want to be known for their bourbon selection but it's not right for everyone.  I hope they revisit their new menu and maybe add well drinks to the cocktail portion .   I would love to come back but it's sadly not likely .
1,Went with a party of 11 and the food was great! Service was on point and the pasta was cooked perfectly. I would go back!
0,"I visited Lilly's on Forbes Avenue in Squirrel Hill last week.  I decided to give it a try because several people were eating at the sidewalk tables and the pasta and meatballs looked good with generous portions.  There are pictures on the wall and you order from the wall menu by building your pasta dish in three steps.  It was dinner time so I ordered ziti (step 1) with pink tomato vodka sauce at a hefty price of $9.99 (step 2) and added meatballs (step 3) from the fresh toppings at 2 for $1.49.  I also ordered a large piece of Tiramisu for $4.99.\n\nThis was a take out order that cost me 30 minutes of my time.  The wait seemed a bit long but I was hungry and looking forward to enjoying my meal when I got home 15 minutes later.\n\nIt was around 7 pm when I ordered this meal on a Wednesday night and they must have been running low on vodka sauce and pasta because both were scarce and what there was of the sauce was bland tasting.  Also, they must have run out of the meatballs I paid for as they were not included in the bag so I can't comment on the taste.  I will say that the young employees they have working there are more concerned with socializing than paying attention to the orders they are filling.  When I got to the dessert, it was half the size of the palm of my hand maybe 4\"" long and 2\"" wide and looked smashed up.  I paid $5.00 for a large size so how small must their small size be for $3.00?  The Tiramisu did not taste fresh made.  More like it came out of a generic frozen box.\n\nDon't waste your hard earned money here.  Rose Tea Cafe just up the street has better noodles than this place!!!"
1,"Their best roll is the oishii.  It's probably my favorite roll in the Pittsburgh area.  The place is reasonably priced and the food overall is of a high quality.  It's a VERY casual place, however and it's located near the University of Pittsburgh in Oakland.  Parking can be a little tough, but there is a small metered parking lot near by."
0,"I am from out of town and have never been to a restaurant at a ball game, so I was excited to go to Front Row to watch the DBacks game. The website gave very conflicting messages about when you could purchase the seats in Front Row for the game, so I gave the restaurant a call over a week in advance. They said I could only purchase tables the day of. I called the night before the game, hoping that maybe they would make an exception because I really wanted these tickets. I then found out that the tickets have been available all season! I asked to speak to the manager, who was the rudest human being I have ever spoke to in my life! After about an hour on the phone with him, tears, and being called a liar, I decided to hang up and just call customer service. I understand that the table I wanted had already been reserved, I just wanted the manager (Lyle) to try to help fix the issue. He said there was nothing he could do, and that \""EVERYONE knows you can buy the tickets all year round\""... what a piece of crock. I cannot believe I was talked to in the way that he spoke to me, and I am so thoroughly upset and aggravated at him. I just read some previous reviews about him on this site, and it's so funny that everyone agrees with me. If you don't have any issue when you go there, then you'll be fine. But if you have even the slightest complaint that has to go through Lyle.... don't expect to leave happy."

0,"I had been to the other Howies on Victoria Street and was quite looking forward to trying out this one. It's located just underneath Carlton hill, inside a beautiful old building. \n\nDespite the great setting the food was a bit of let down. I came here about 3 months ago and ordered the vennison stew with chocolate. Very excited to try this exotic sounding dish we were presented with food, which tasted like it had just been microwaved. Have you ever smelt meat and potatoes that have been microwaved? They have that distinct smell and taste. To add to this, the bread pudding with custard I had, although delicious to start with, was dry in the middle.\n\nThe girl serving our table was very friendly, although you could she was new on the job. She couldn't understand the order of wine we wanted and kept getting mixed up. Also it took them ages to come take our order in the first place and there weren't that many other customers. \n\nI know Howies can do a lot better and I hope this was a one-off thing. Their menu is always impressive and I hope I can write a positive update to this review in the near future."

1,"I have to say, same great food as the other location, but slightly better service. \nWent with the Pulled Pork Sandwich again and it didn't disappoint. One small difference; They put the slaw on top of the sandwich!  Fries were very good as well. One day I will try some of their regular entrees instead of the sandwich. If you're craving BBQ Meat goodies, and are in the area, you won't be disappointed."
1,"Four Peaks is one of my GO TO places in Tempe. Atmosphere is laid back, local delicious beers and wonderful food. Great restaurant for any occasion- birthdays, groups, football Sunday, laid back date night.\n\nSunday brunch is a must. The food is amazing and they have the best bloody mary in town.\n\nPersonal Favorites:\nBeer: Hop Knot or Pumpkin Porter in October \nFood: Salmon BLT, no bacon add avocado, Portabella Beer Bread, Cheese Enchiladas\nSunday Brunch: Breakfast Beer Bread or the Enchiladas and Eggs"
1,"Lucky enough to get a table just strolling by.  Of course, we were dressed up, so that may have helped. In any case I'm not a meat eater but I still found something TE here-the parsnip pur\u00e9e was to die for. My martini was so so so delicious. Service was perfection. We had a lovely table, not on the patio but lovely nonetheless. Other diners were super happy, and my dining partner had a really good looking steak, which she truly enjoyed.  If, and it's a big if, I ever go back to Vegas, I will for sure eat here again, and bring my husband. Maybe :-)."
0,Don't know what I ordered here but it was dirt cheap. Probably less than $3.\n\nYou get what you pay for but the food is cheap quick and easy. There's an 80% chance that Sam could be serving you. Say hi.
0,"Was here yesterday and the service was beyond slow... my food order was wrong.... TWICE! The girl that took my order was nice, but that's about the only positive thing I have to say about this place. The food was.... forgettable...  I would've been better off going to McDonalds and saving myself a couple bucks. The service and the food is just not worth it."
1,"this place.\n\nthis place is just..  well its just awesome.\n\nwent there for the first time a couple weeks ago and i'm sorry that i'm just now writing this review, because i can't remember the name of the bartender, but let me tell you about what i DO remember - this guy was incredible.  he honestly made our experience unforgettable and because of him, we will most definitely be going back.  I didnt eat any food, but the 2 people i were with got pizzas, and they seemed to enjoy them.  then of course, there's the beer.  now, i'm not a huge beer drinker, but if i was, this place would be my go to.  sure there are other great places to grab a local (or not-so-local) beer, but how many of them are brewed and served inside of a church?  The inside of this place was incredible.  I loved how they kept the church feel to the building, but then, of course, there's all the beer.  \n\nThis place is just a really great, different kind of place to go grab a drink and some food, and, if your lucky, arguably the best bartender in PGH."
0,"First off...having to wait at any airport for more than an hour is annoying. However, there are times when you cannot avoid it. And during those times, you're only hope is that there's a place where you can sit, relax, and have some food and drinks. Having pleasant service is a plus as well.\n\nIf you find yourself stuck in Terminal 2 at Skyharbor Airport, then stay on the unsecured side and visit the bar there. The service I rec'd from Debbie at the All Star was standard at best in the beginning. It went down hill towards the end and was inexcusable at the end when she put the check down...that I didn't even ask for. Then came back 5 minutes later and told me...not ask me but told me to close my bill because she was leaving! I still have 3 hours until my flight but after Debbie...I got up and left, went back out to the unsecured area and sat down. Received outstanding service there. And going back through security was better than giving more money to this establishment."
0,"There's really not a whole lot about the Nitty Gritty that needs to be said other than this: It's OK at best.\n\nThe food isn't amazing, the drinks are mediocre, and the atmosphere is loud and generally overcrowded. It's nothing to write home about, but when it's your birthday--why not? Free stuff isn't a bad reason to come here, but there's no reason to come here otherwise when there's much better places to go."
0,"Bad customer Service. They sell out of date items also. Way over priced as well, if your search a little better you can bet a better deal for the same item."
0,Got a small $3 coffee to go. $3 coffee tastes the same as $1 coffee. \n\nMIGHT come back for food.
0,"I first of all found it odd that a place would open up called Twin Peaks when there is a 4 Peaks around the corner.  A bunch of us decided to give it a try for happy hour & it was ehhh at best.   Visually inside it is nice with the cabin feel and young girls in next to nothing. But the bartenders were weak, food was nothing to go back for and it felt like a JV team at best. But also taking in to consideration it did just open and the girls are not hired based on performance. \n\nThe only thing it did have going for it was the people watching.  With a ratio of 1 girl to every 5 middle aged dbag it made for good entertainment."
1,"My friends and I were craving Italian food to rid of our Vegas hangover so after looking around the Venetian, we decided on Canaletto because it looked authentic and had many customers. We were directed to a nice table by the window that overlooked the Gondola rides and the Italian singers.\n\nThe setting at Canaletto is casual/formal and ambiance was quite nice. I really liked our waiter because it he was this very jolly and talkative Italian man. He was very quick about bringing us bread and drinks because we were famished. Also, there was only a short wait because our entrees all arrived. Our waiter kept us company throughout dinner and wanted to share a story with us. I don't know whether to be amused or annoyed that he was basically telling a story about how asians lower the costs/prices of everything so that other countries cannot compete in the global market. But anyways, it made for an interesting dinner conversation. \n\nOur entrees were surprising tasteful. I found the menu somewhat hard to navigate through because everything was Italian. They had a wide selection of wines imported from Italy, France and California. Then again, it should be expected since it's Vegas. \n\nMost of us ordered pasta dishes. A couple of dishes that stood out were:\n-Linguine alla Buranella: thin flat pasta with mussels, prawns, scallops and clams seasoned with tomatoes, crushed red pepper, garlic and trebbiano wine. It smelled delicious and reminded me of pasta cooked in a bouillabaisse \n-Cannelloni di Pollo: large pasta tubes filled with rotisserie chicken, mushrooms, organic spinach, sundried tomatoes and\nsmoked mozzarella; bechamel and tomato sauces. The cannelloni was baked in a cast iron dish so it was piping hot when served. My friend said this was rich, delicious and worth ordering. \n-Zuppa Di Pesce Alla Chioggiotta. I really like the name because when spoken properly, it sounds really cool. Essentially, it is an italian version of bouillabaisse--seafood stew with scampi, prawns, scallops, clams, mussels and fresh fish fillet. Grilled garlic ciabatta bread comes with it. I thought that this was cooked perfectly--seafood was tender and sweet and the aromatic smell the white wine was just divine. I could have used more bread to soak up the juices. \n\nOverall, dinner at Canaletto was an enjoyable experience. It is a little more expensive than other restaurants for each entree was at least $20. The quality of the meal was one of the better ones I've had at Las Vegas. So if you're ever staying in the Venetian and looking for a place to eat, check it out. My only regret was that our group was too full to order desserts. So if go, save room!  Buon appetito!"
1,"Great tailoring hands down. I've had jeans taken in, dresses altered and hems taken up - all perfectly done. I will say, though, that you get what you pay for, i.e. it's not affordable tailoring.  A pair of jeans cost $20 to be taken in, and $20 for hemmed pants or dress. While I personally think it's worth it for expert tailoring, others may think it's a bit overpriced for some of the basic tailoring. \n\nAlso, the staff are all very nice and will give very helpful tailoring advice when asked. You can trust your nicest pieces here - they are in good hands!"
0,"Tried Atlanta Bread Company for the first (and last) time this week.  Food was very mediocre.  Fillings of sandwiches were fine, but the bread tasted stale.  To be named \""Atlanta BREAD Company\"" and not have bread that knocks your socks off is ridiculous.  Not to mention the unfriendly manager and a front door that wouldn't open properly.  Overall, not a good experience."
0,"So disappointed. The room was cold, the massage was erratic and had no flow. There were times when the pressure was fine- like in the very beginning when she asked- but then it was so light it was almost tickling! She seemed to want to focus on areas other than requested and seemed to need to use a stool to sit down a lot. It really felt like she wasn't into it so as awkward as it was- I asked her to stop. When I went to check out, I stood at the desk for over 5 minutes while 2 ladies behind the desk were on the phone. I was surprised by their lack of interest that the massage was substandard and they proceeded to charge me. I guess I'm grateful it was only the $30 for 30 minutes of massage but there was a sign in front of me that 'if your massage was unsatisfactory, let us know so we can make it right for you' That did not happen. I will not be back."
0,"If John Lennon and George Harrison rose from the dead to play one more Beatles concert at the Nile, I wouldn't go.  It was easily 90 degrees inside and they actually have the audacity to charge $2 for a re-entry wristband."
0,"This place gets 1 star for the food and 3 stars for the desserts.\n\nI would have thought that the creators of this buffet would take a lesson from places like Bellagio and Wynn, but they obviously were sleeping during class.  The crab legs were sooooo salty and gummy.  The fish dishes were overcooked.  The indian curries were bland.  I did like the prime rib, but don't forget to put the au jus!\n\nThe upside is that I think they spent all the time and effort on the dessert section.  The dessert offerings were plated individually and they were beautiful!  They also tasted good.  My favorites were the Nutella cake and the caramel flan.  Ice cream, cookies, biscotti, and brownies were also offered.\n\nOur server was very attentive and nice.  I cannot say the same for the people manning the different food areas.  No one could tell me what veggie was in the chicken curry (I figured out it was spinach).  \n\nWe went for lunch, and it was $20 per person.  I wouldn't come back here unless they revamped their offerings."
1,"I loooove this place!\n\nBeen here twice and both GREAT experiences...\n\nFirst had brunch here a couple weeks ago, and we were a happy bunch to say the least... they had an all you can drink champagne brunch for $18.00 i think... i honestly can't remember right now (=P) but it was pretty cheap and the food we got was insanely HUGE! They started us out first with freshly made mini donettes.. and lemme just say how much i LOOOOOVEEEE mini donettes, mini donuts people not donut holes. =)  AND THE MEAL:  i had a steak salad.. and it looked more like an open faced steak sandwich. . . believe me, it was delicious none the less.  \n\nof course i sampled everyone else's food ... chopped salad = my fav, french toast with fruit = YAY, and there was one more dish and it was delicious but.... the mimosas' have permanently erased it from my mind for some reason.  \n\n2nd time around, was over this past weekend for dinner with my bf and my cousins... and being the boys that they are... i was worried about them getting enough food in their tummies and was seriously considering a nasty buffet over this. good thing i didn't pick the buffet.  Our meal started with a pitcher of strawberry margarita (Y-U-M-M-MY), the philly cheesesteak dumplings and pulled pork eggrolls - small in size but it was an appetizer so was perfect to begin the meal off with.  Entree's: Filet Mignon, Linguine & clams, BBq Brisket with cheesy grits,  Grilled Salmon & Citrus salad, Tuna Au Poivre, and Shrimp with an Eggplant pasta situation ( can't remember).  Everything we had at the table with very delicious, well seasoned, perfectly cooked.  \n\nThe service was absolutely great both times... never had an empty water glass or champagne flute =) Our waiters constantly checked up on us to see if we needed anything else which earned them big tips =). The music was great and we had a beautiful view of the strip from our booth... so definitely get a booth if you find urself here.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place, and has made a true fan out of me. =)  I will be back to enjoy you again. =)"

Great gaming floor.  Great bars within.  \n\nIf you're looking for a more relaxed vibe, stay away.  hehe."
1,"I have been coming here since 2008, and I have to say...it's all good, every time! The service is always friendly and outstanding, which goes miles with me...but add to that such a great, unique and tasty menu that non-vegetarians like me are swayed to eat veg. I mean, vegan po' boys, kung pao, coconut curry, garden burgers, meatball sandwiches--all of which are tastier than the so-called \""real things\"". I had the spicy bbq chicken sandwich with a side of curry pasta salad today, which rocked, and with a friend who hadn't been in yet, and who, I'm sure, will be back. May I also suggest the thyme fries, which are a bit of awesome. I don't care about the so-called \""scenesters\"" that one reviewer was complaining about. I like that they replaced the standard soda fountain with a lineup of kombucha, Izze, and other healthy drinks. I just eat happily and enjoy myself here, and notice that everyone else is generally doing exactly the same.\n\nGo Green!"
1,"While passing through Las Vegas, on our way to Reno, we stopped into this cute juice bar with some really cool bicycles in front. Since we had been driving all day, the nice lady behind the counter recommended a couple of 1 oz. wheat grass shots to give us more energy for the rest of our journey. She took great care to run the wheat grass through the juicer a few times to be sure she got every drop of juice out! I've had wheatgrass before but I don't remember it being this sweet. I don't know where they source theirs from but it was probably the best I've had. \n\nWe also got a couple of their fresh juices. One with a green base of kale, spinach, cucumbers and ginger. The other had a beet base with ginger and other fruits. They were both really good and refreshing. Even my kids liked them. We didn't try their food since we were on a pretty tight travel schedule but we will definitely be back the next time we come to Vegas!"
0,"I attended a conference at Planet Hollywood (PH), Las Vegas last week (Mar 9th to Mar 15th).  The only reason I stayed there was because the conference had a package deal with the hotel.  In retrospect, I should had stayed in another hotel and just cab it every day to the conference.  The only thing PH has going for it is its location.  Excellent location on the strip, but the actual hotel and service, I would rank it with a Best Western or Holiday Inn. \n \nWhen we arrived at the hotel (around 1:00 PM), it took us almost 30 minutes to check-in.  During check-in, the front staff told me that there is an \""early check-in fee of $16.00\""?!?!?!?!  What the hell!  I actually laughed when they told me this, as I have never heard of this!  Usually in ALL other hotels in this world, if the room is ready, you can check-in, no problem, if not, you wait.  But, according to PH, the early check-in fee is Caesars' Entertaining policy!  I am still shaking my head on that one, you would think in Vegas, the faster you get your hotel guest in the casino the better.\n \nThe room was no better than any other 3-start hotel that I have stayed in the past.  Room was in desperate need of an update.  Carpet, bed, furniture, etc in need of replacement.  The closet was actually missing a door!  Cool pictures on the wall, but who cares about that.  Not me.\n \nInternet - there is a charge of $14 per day... now that is expected for most hotels, but wait for it.... $14 per day.... PER DEVICE!  Yes, per device!  Laptop, that's $14 and IPad that's another $14... that's about $30 per day plus tax!   I have never heard of that one either!  Now that's two things I have never heard or experienced with any other hotel anywhere in Vegas or in this world for that matter.  During the conference, this was a hot topic.... It is nothing and the hotel dismisses it when one person complains about this fee and \""one device policy\"", but when a whole group of conference attendees is discussing the same issue and feel the same way, PH, you need to pay attention!\n \nPool - Closed!  In March! Now, they told us we could use the pool in the Paris hotel... hmmm.... OK, if you have ever been to Vegas, you know how close and \""walkable\"" Vegas can be.  Just a short little trip to the next hotel to use the pool.... Yeah... right.\n \nGym - Now usually, when we go to Vegas, who uses the gym... right?  But, since it was a conference and it was 6 days we tried to use the gym.... But wait for it.... again... must be a PH (Caesars' Entertaining) thing... there is a charge of $25 per day.... That's OK.... But that's PER PERSON!  Crap!  So, for the two of us that's $50 per day, $250 for the week, that's more than what my gym membership costs for the WHOLE YEAR!  What's with this hotel and their Mickey Mouse nickel and dime game!\n \nAs I mentioned before, PH is in a great location.  But, PH caters to the younger crowd (21 to 25 years old) that is there just to gamble and drink, probably why it can get away with its \""policies\"".  But a more seasoned traveler will know better and see through this sham.  I for one, will skip this hotel next time we go to Vegas, we will still visit the Miracle Mile Mall, but skip Planet Hollywood.  With so many WAY BETTER hotels in the immediate area, why stay at Planet Hollywood?  I don't see any reason.\n\nI would sincerely hope the conference organizers pick a better hotel next time."
0,"Dirty store and poor quality clothing. Also, my thoughts when walking by the store are, \""were they blind when they hired their merchandiser?\"" 2 stories of cheaply made crap. I go for the tank tops, pajamas and cheap fashion jewelry."
1,"Oh Dads. Quick breakfast/lunch, great to have nearby to grab some quick or ready to eat food on the go. I know them as being open 24/7 but apparently that has changed recently. It was always the same gentleman behind the counter, smiling and grinning at the drunks that walked through his door. I remember one night he asked my friend and I if we had been drinking (we most certainly had) and whipped out a bottle of Jameson from beneath the counter and said \""ME TOO!\"". We ended up leaving with a dozen bagels, 10 beef patties, a big bag of wings, and half a bag full of things we didn't even order. We left having paid only $12 and he gave us each a styrofoam cup with 2-3 ounces of Jameson. Classic drunk nights."
1,"Considering that finding delivery in South Phoenix is nearly impossible, this place is a gem. We stopped in to get take out because they do not have an online menu, and we were rather pleasantly surprised by the quality and flavor of the food, not to mention the great prices... Under $4 for lunch??? Seriously!.  The staff was friendly and the food was quickly prepared and hot when we drove it home.  We would order from here again in a heartbeat."

1,Love Ahso!!! Favorite place to go. Happy hour at 9;00 has best prices for fabulous food. I don't eat rice so I had them replace with soy paper and it was delicious... Awesome food and service. Great for little get togetherness with friends or date. They have a DJ on Saturday nights. No dancing but good atmosphere.

1,"I love this place.  The lunch buffet is amazing (especially considering it's less than $11 per person). They have a good variety of different rolls and Chinese food on the lunch buffet.  For the dinner menu they also have extensive options, and a specials sheet that changes seasonally (which is really nice).  While the dinner menu is obviously pricier than the lunch menu it is still reasonable.  I recommend trying this place out, if for nothing else, for the lunch buffet!"
1,"I LOVE this thrift store! By far the best thrift store ever, and I have been in a lot of them. Yes, it could be a little cleaner, but it's large, and well organized. I have to bring an extra suitcase when I visit my Mom, and sometimes need to ship items of clothing and shoes home! I find jeans, shorts, tops, and shoes, all with brand names and stylish. Sometimes I feel as if the items are a little pricey, then think of how much the item was when it was brand new, and can see why it's priced as it is. I could spend hours in this store!"

1,"My daughter and I are always looking around for great sushi places. We found Hana's on Yelp and tried it out for dinner. It's a small, unpretentious resturant run by a family.....very small town flavor, no frills, but clean. The sushi was excellent and the prices were extremely reasonable. This is one of those little neighborhood hole-in-the-wall gems the locals like to keep a secret. Now I know and I will definitely be visiting often....yum!"
1,"My husband has been raving about this place for months and I finally went today.  I kept thinking, its just hot dogs, what is the big deal?  But I was thoroughly impressed and I will definitely go back.  The owner and cook were friendly and our food came out quick and just as we ordered.  My husband is one of the pickiest eaters on the planet, so the fact that this place has him eating sweet and savory flavor combos on a hot dog is enough to warrant 4 stars, and the fifth star is just because it was so darn tasty."
1,"I came here for brunch, as they were rolling out some of the lunch items out already.  Compared to the other hotel buffets, this one wasn't too bad actually.  Our waitress was pretty nice though, smiled a lot and was very courteous.  An extra star for that one."
1,"I love this place, aided significantly by the fact that raw bar chef Jason Nagy served as both purveyor of fine shell fishies, and  generally as a kick ass guide  / friend in Montreal. Mix that with resounding hospitality from the bar staff (Sabrina in particular) and this restaurant saw ample of my time and dollars during my four day business jaunt through the city.\n\nSteaks are fabulous, and actually a strong value compared against chain beef merchants (Ruth Chris, Morton's etc). I will also go on record as saying that the poutin is worth dying for; which is good, because if you ate it regularly, you'd die. \n\nI would recommend a smattering of apps (include the tartar) the raw bar especially during happy hour and lots of booze.  Make it during a happy hour, if for no other reason than to peep the DJ....and i dont mean his musical set.\n\nExceptionally cool, delicious and perfectly located."

0,"Overpriced. If they cut their prices by a 1/3 and gave that money to preserving rain forests, they'd be doing their patrons and the environment a humongous favor. For these prices, I'd go elsewhere. The only reasonably priced items are the salads, sandwiches and burgers hidden on the 2nd from last page--of course. The three of us had the Chinese chicken salad for $13.99 each and sparkling water, soda and ice tea.\n\nThis place has to be family and birthday central. I think I saw enough sparkler candles for me to forgo the 4th of July this year. Then all the animatronic animals do their roar and squawk routine occasionally. They are probably upset they aren't getting a cut of the outrageous prices.\n\nVerdict: Stop global warming and price gouging by avoiding this tourist and bad food trap."
0,"I had a hard time finding this restaurant to review it because at first I thought it was called As Seen on Food Network....but I found it so on with the review. My wife first introduced me to this place by bringing it home one night for dinner. It was horrible; but I chalked this up to what I ordered (a dish that was a cross between Mexican and Italian food) and the fact that it was cold from the drive home. So when we were in the area we decided to go in and sit down for a meal and enjoy the atmosphere. Well enjoy I did...nothing says a nice night out to dinner like tables covered with paper and plastic cups for you can drink (don't adjust your screen; this is not a review for Peter Piper Pizza). But hey, I am not a snob; I love places that save on the little things so they can put it in the food. But sadly this was not the case; it was not the worst Italian I have ever had, I am old enough to remember Wendy's super bar with fettuccine alfredo and hamburger bun bottoms cut in half and slathered in garlic butter. But for the price and the hype it was strike two; I had a Caesar salad and a pasta in cream sauce; both decent portions but nothing to write home about in the end. The service was poor, we did not get the specials but luckily we heard it given to the table beside us (just not lucky enough to have this happen before we ordered). We also ordered bread with our entrees but it never came out. I think my wife summed up our service experience best when she said that at the very least she expected the waiter to pour her can Coke into her plastic cup for her. The bill came and I found myself paying top dollar for mediocre food and poor service; strike three, ball game."
1,"I came here for lunch on a lovely Friday afternoon. It's directly across from the Bellagio hotel.. if you sit in the patio area you might be lucky enough to catch the beautiful water show! not sure, if you would be able to hear the music though. Location wise, it's one of the best places to eat on the strip! It's smack in the middle of the strip.\n\nAvoid sitting in the patio area in the summer time. It'll be too hot to eat in the scorching sun! Be sure to wear sunblock and sunglasses! :-)\n\nThe food was really tasty... the bread was so buttery! :) I ordered steak and fries! My friend ordered crepe/scallops/shrimp... it was so creamy and so delcious. My other friend ordered the open face BLT with avocado.. it was a little messy to eat... but it was delicious nonetheless."
0,"Extremely disappointed and very angry dog owner today! I took my dog here recently for his 3rd and Final visit. My first 2 visits were great, but the last one lost my faith for good on their unprofessional and uncaring service.\n\nI have a Frenchie with a very sensitive stomach. In the multiple page application they have you fill out I mention that, as well as advised them that the cause of his stomach ailments is rawhide treats. In fact I put on his application that he is ALLERGIC to rawhides and mentioned not to give it to him because he gets bad diarrhea. So when I took him the last time, my dog apparently threw a \""temper tantrum\"" which usually means he squeals  really loud when you crate him. I advised the owner of this and she assured me they get that all the time and they can handle it. Well let me tell you how they \""handled\"" it. Yup, to quiet him up, they gave him a rawhide treat which he swallowed whole. When the handler that day told me that I was extremely upset. And rightfully so because tonight my poor guy is suffering from awful diarrhea. He is not as active and constantly having to go. \n\nWhat compounded matters more is the gal at the desk was looking over my paperwork to see where I mentioned rawhide and she couldn't find out. I advised her that the paperwork she was reading wasn't mine, and then she laughed it off when she realized her mistake and thought it read wrong because the documents described a cat's history. I was already so angry that they did not read my paperwork, but she was so unskilled to realize the difference between a cat and a dog. I had to point out her error, opposed to her not figuring out that my dog was not abandoned by a cat like the paperwork said. Ugh!!!! When I first visited I was also advised that I shouldn't worry about treats because rawhide is not one of them. Well guess what, it is. \n\nIf you take your dog here, make sure they read your documents. Go over everything with them and mention your dogs issues, otherwise you'll end up like me staying up to take care and clean up after your sick puppy."

I was paying attention because someone that I cared about was there and I wanted to make sure they were in a nice clean place. I noticed that the nurses were very attentive and caring. They helped my friend out so much! Nothing but a pleasant experience here."
0,"Mediocre food with extremely horrible service. The staff was not only rude to the customers, but were fighting with each other. The guy who took our order had a chip on his shoulder and treated us as if we were annoying him. He didn't listen to my order and when I told him he messed up, he told me that he already placed my food in the oven...kinda a \""oh-well\"" to it. The baked goods were not good enough for me to come back and deal with all of the negativity that was in that place tonight. I'm sorry Amelie's but you have lost yet another paying customer."
1,"Love love love their food. Really innovative in combining technique with different flavors. \n\nThe stand outs are their kushi oysters with Tabasco sorbet and tequila mignonette, and poached egg with potato and truffles. \n\nThey also have smaller portions of items at their bar if you don't want the whole dining room experience.\n\nBut if you do want the entire experience, I highly suggest their $89 chef menu. You get a good menu with choices in each course. \n\nA must go if in Las Vegas."
0,"After checking out a laser show, rainstorm, the fountains and almost all the stores at Miracle Mile, it's time for tea.\n\nWe needed change and it had started raining outside.  I like Coffee Bean's Japanese Cherry and was amused to discover you can follow them on Twitter and Facebook.  What could a coffee shop possibly have to say?  I was curious to find them and check it out but disappointed that my tea was made wrong.  The water was poured boiled hot which scorched the tea bag making my tea bitter. I drank some of it anyway because it was getting really cold in Vegas and we had to leave the shops soon for our next adventure."
1,"Oh my gosh Nola - now when this place opened everyone talked about it and loved it and raved and I never went. Finally this weekend I got the chance to experience and I thought it was great. The wine selection (which was what I wanted) was great and to be honest I just wanted some pasta so when they turned out to have pasta I was a happy camper. I very much recommend the dish I had, the Pasta Pontchartrain. There was a little kick to the sauce and the meat and crawfish in the dish were perfect.  Everyone in my party had a great meal - I'm pretty sure the grit cakes were called the best meal my dining partner had ever had. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable and the environment was fun -I'm going to go ahead and highly recommending trying this place."
0,"I went in to Walkers and spent close to $2800.00 on a bedroom set and a dinning room set and some mattresses on 7/26/14. At the time I purchased the items a number of thing were not divulged to me. The fact that the bedroom set I had purchased was not in stock and I was told it would be delivered the next week, but it is 8/1/14 and no bedroom set for maybe a couple weeks????? The dining room set I purchased arrived with some wear on it, I called to have it replaced and when they came to pick up the old set the new set also had \""distressed\"" markings on it. I was never told that the table was \""distressed\"" when I paid full price for a brand new table and chairs. Someone needs to let the consumer know at the time of purchase when an item will be delivered and if it is being sold \""as it\"" or \""distressed\"". Nothing was ever said to me about this or is there any notation on my paperwork."
0,"After having had lunch at the Grill at Eagle Mountain Fountain Hills, AZ, we looked forward to being able to someday stay at the beautiful resort. A trip to AZ that was related to a recently deceased parent was made better with the fact that my husband booked a suite at the Inn at Eagle Mountain for the 1 night we needed to be in town. 6 weeks prior to our trip he made the reservations and we received confirmation. We looked forward to taking solace in the gorgeous surroundings. We arrived in Phoenix and as we were being shuttled to the car rental facility, my husband turned his phone on. A voice mail had been left from the Inn telling us they did not have a room for us. We immediately called to find out what the problem was and were told they \""we're very sorry, but...\"" they had no rooms available. When we explained we had confirmation from a reservation made through the hotel (not a travel outfit), they again apologized saying \""it appeared we had been 'mistakenly' wait-listed\"". They offered to find us a \""comparable place to stay\"".  We arrived at the Inn about 30 mins later. Our first question was why were we not notified until we had arrived in town. Their reply was that they were waiting to see if there might be a last minute cancellation. As an explanation we were told that new owners had recently taken over and were not well versed in the customer service aspect of hotel management. The receptionists agreed that this was unacceptable.  They did get us booked into another local hotel. Far from the beautiful ambiance of the Eagle Mt properties and the comfort of a king-size suite, we were directed to the nearby Marriott Courtyard, in a room with double beds. Disappointed, doesn't describe how we felt. A \""sorry\"" from the desk and absolutely no suggestion of compensation left us feeling as though we were unimportant as guests. So, no, we will not be returning to Inn at Eagle Mountain! We will not be recommending the Inn at Eagle Mountain."
0,"Warning, Do Not go here!!\nWent here with a group of friends Halloween weekend.  Our group paid the cover charge to get in, they had advertised on facebook that women are free to get in which was not true.  As soon as we paid to get in my husband was turned around two steps in the door by the bouncers to the parking lot and informed him he can't go in.  My husband went peacefully outside and asked for his money back that they took from him for a cover charge.  He was then tackled to the ground by the thug bouncers busting open his lip and giving him a sprang ankle.  He was out in the parking lot!  My husband was not hostile, and just wanted to have a good time with our friends not to be attacked by the staff for no reason!  This place doesn't care about it's customers and feels it's in their right to assault anyone they choose to pick on.  Do not support this club/restaurant... I will be telling everyone to stay far away.. My husband is a gentle man and would not cause any trouble. Also the club is loud, overpriced, crowded, dirty, and has really shitty music.."
1,"This place is like McDonalds for me. Its consistent good. It's not the best quality kbbq meat, but it's damn good, and good enough. The meat drippings fall onto all that kimchee and bean sprouts which they use for an excellent heart stopping fried rice at the end. \n\nThis time my family of 4 ordered a combo for 3-4 and the blood sausage soup (best here). Didn't even make it to the rice at the end. Totally stuffed and completely satisfied. \n\nAmazingly, the male server was very polite and attentive too. He needs to teach those ladies how to do things."
1,"Updating my review from my last experience ... I'm impressed ..\nFood was good, service was good !\nI guess you can say I'm glad I gave it another try.\n\nThelma's Special is my favorite ..\nNew item we tried is the Longanisa Musubi! Which was D E L I C I O U S!"
0,"I can't stand this place. It's always filled with a bunch of drunks, it smells, and the karaoke could put me in the grave. The last time I went, I was DD and the waitress tried getting a double tip out of my drunk friends. I didn't appreciate her taking advantage of my friends (who had no clue what was going on) so swore I'd never be back. And, I haven't."
0,"I have been there 3 times in the last couple of years, and each time I regret it due to my low noise tolerance.  Although many people have said this is a good place for music, the acoustics in the cafe is horrendous and the service is extremely slow.\n\nEach time I went, I ordered food. The food is good, but it takes, on average, 30-60min for your food to arrive.  I suspect that the owner is very cheap that I only saw 1 (at the very most 2) waitresses on my 3 visits which include Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night in summer time (I'd say this is probably as busy as it gets).  This is probably why the food is super slow.\n\nThe drinks are made poorly. It is a wine bar after all.\n\nHowever, if you like loud music and prefer to go out alone, this might be a good choice. But if you invited friends and want to have any sort of conversation without your throat burning from yelling all night, avoid this place. I swear I will never set foot in here again."
1,All I can say is YUM! Melt in your mouth leaving you speechless after you sink your teeth into this delicious slices of pizza. I got a basic cheese pizza with basil and pepperoni and I was blown away! I've had many pizzas around Las Vegas and this place tops them all. That's right boys and girls! It's better than Grimaldis and all of those other hole in the wall places that are also good :) Good job guys! You will be seeing a pregnant 49er fan who is always craving for pizza at your spot. BTW the customer service there is excellent. The staff is very helpful and friendly.\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant!
1,"Came across this place on a whim, but glad I stopped in. Defiantly has some unique burgers on the menu. I went with a pork and beef burger with Chinese sausage on a Taro bun. Also had some mushrooms on it. Good flavor and the taro bun actually had taro flavor to it! Bad part of the meal would be that the fries did not come with the burger, everything is ala cart.  I liked the sauce that came with the fries. Would recommend anyone to come here that's going to Vegas."
1,"This was the best meal we had in Vegas, by far. Maybe it was because we tried to go to 2 other places prior that were either closed or had a long wait and we were just hungry, but I'm going to venture that it was actually just that good.\n\nThe hostess seated us semi-promptly by Vegas standards and they had a pretty full house. Our waiter was friendly, engaged us in conversation (but not too much), and was willing to give suggestions.\n\nFirst of all, I have to gush about the olive tapenade they serve with the bread basket - OMG! As a lover of all things olive, I would go back just for this. \n\nI started off with a tropical martini concoction. I can't even remember what was in it (pineapple juice?), but it was really yummy and had the perfected sugar rim. But it was also $14. Yikes.\n\nSince we were starving (it was 11 pm our 'home' time), we ordered the prosciutto and fig flatbread. It was simply delicious. It had whole figs, and COVERED in prosciutto. Toppings tended to fall off as you took a bite, but it was still delicious.\n\nI had the Chicken and Gnocchi and it was really good. The chicken wasn't as well prepared as the gnocchi and sauce, but overall it was really good. The downside was the flatbread was so large and the olive spreads were so good, I was full by time I got my entree.\n\nOne thing I will say is a downside is it is a little pricey for what we got - 1 flatbread, 2 pasta entrees (one with sausage and mine had chicken), and a drink each and it was nearly $150 with tax and tip."
1,"After doing my Yelp research, I went to Europin to alter a dress for me.  I was completely satisfied with the alteration and really surprising impressed with their kindness and customer service.  Very very nice people.  I would absolutely go again for alteration needs that pop up in the future."
1,"Great food with great flavor, nice place to have a romantic dinner, I had the paella with was delicious but my girlfriend had the lamb which I thought I would have order that too. The waiter was very polite and always there if we needed something I would definitely go back and try some other foods on there menu."
1,"Very pretty inside!  Great prices!  The service was a little slow, but the food was great!  The tortilla soup was my fav!  The chicken fajitas are only $8.99 with your players boarding pass!  They also have a nice sized salsa bar with a great selection of salsas, from mild to extra hot!  You really cant beat it with the price and taste of food!"
1,"I'm a fan of their happy hour. It's everyday from 2pm-6pm.  I posted a picture of the happy hour menu, so you can visualize what you might like.\n\nI came in on a weekday, around 4-5pm.  It wasn't busy, thankfully, because I was starving.  I sat myself down at the sushi bar, and the bartender quickly came by, greeted me, and got my drink and app order down.  I ordered a refreshing cucumber cocktail ($5)... it had a fancy shamncy name, but I forget what it was called.  It was a part of the happy hour cocktail menu, however, so it's easy to find.  For food, I ordered the chili edamame, furikake salmon poke, and spider roll.  Everything was good; delightful for a happy hour.  I also ordered an Asahi, $2 draft.  Will definitely be back to try the other happy hour items!"

1,"There aren't enough adjectives or stars. If you only see one show, this is it. Stunning!"
0,"These guys have good BBQ, the only problem is they cook to their demographic so everything is over cooked, and they go light on their sauce on some and extremly heavy on many other items. Many bland items, but good happy hour specials and appitizers, and some good spicy bbq items.  Kind of pricy for what you get compared to others. Also the ditsy watresses would rather flit with guys in the back than ask you if you need a refill or something.(famous daves is way better) If I lived in sun city I would probably rate this establishment  with 4 or more stars but this young buck looks elsewhere for bbq delight. Texaz bbq or famous daves are much better choices."
0,"Oh hell no girlfriend, uh-uh. \n\nI don't know what that drooler in the white shirt was thinking, grinding up on me like that without introduction, but I'm pretty damn sure my punch in the chest got my message across. Look-look-no-touch, thank you.\n\nThis place was, meh, average, kinda crappy music, DJ didn't play requests and kept pausing the music in all the wrong places to scream shit about Jagerbombs. Every. Five. Minutes.\n\nHad to run around the dance floor a bit trying to avoid the rather grab-assy \""gentlemen\"" that were present, and yes a wooden doll got lowered from the ceiling that vaguely resembled Frankenstein's monster. To their credit, they did play Michael Jackson's Thriller,  but then again, what else would you play to go with that?\n\nKeep walkin' people, if you've got to set the bouncer on the chavs to keep off your body (for their safety really, I would've done them more harm), you know it's not the place to be. \n\nFrankenstein, somehow that name is oddly appropriate..."
0,"Saw the show in NYC last year and again this month. The show used to feature English \""rock-opera\"" vocals... and now it just features the Cirque gibberish you may be used to. The English lyrics were utter nonsense and I thought the show would have been improved without them. It wasn't. Now the characters just stand on stage and sing to the audience but the audience has no idea what they're saying. (Two of the people I went with thought the words were in French and they just didn't understand because they didn't speak it.) It's like they didn't bother to change the staging when they got rid of the story, and the end result is awful. Plus the female screeching has got to go. Bring earplugs.\n\nThe second half of the show features some really good acrobatic acts. The trapeze is one of the best out there, though Myst\u00e8re's new trapeze act certainly rivals it and makes Zarkana feel redundant. We've also seen the Wheel of Death before in K\u00c0. But the handbalancing scene is stunningly beautiful, and the final group acrobatic number is excellent.\n\nApart from that, though, there's not much to write home about. Most of the music is amateur and forgettable. The stage is pretty at times, especially in the first few scenes, but the projections get old after a while. The whole space scene is complete nonsense, out of place and entirely unacceptable. I was pretty bored up until the last couple acts, so I can't recommend this show."
1,"I went there for a friend's birthday party.  The decor was very different, you feel like you are in one of the girl clothing store (Modern Luxury feel).  The food was pretty good for it's price.  I had Salmon Salad, Burger and Hanger Steak.  The steak came out cold the first time but the Chef apologize and went ahead made us a new plate right away.  The service was good but it was slow... Our server was nice but everything came out the kitchen were just slow."
0,Ehhhh the food was expensive and not very good. I hoped for better and have had better.
1,Great staff and doctors.
0,"Maybe I'm just too old for this place but as a 30 year old, I felt like an outsider.  Everyone there seemed to be between 18-22, which to me, seems strange at a bar in downtown Phoenix.  I would have expected feeling that way on Mill Ave! Not that I go to Mill Ave ;) but seriously.  I was with a group of people ranging from 26 to 35 and we all felt extremely old and out of place.  It's a young, hipster place where there's only one beer on draft (it was some vanilla Hefeweizen.... I never heard of Hefeweizen with vanilla and I think there's a very good reason) and nothing good in bottles either (budweiser, miller high life, PBR, schlitz, etc).  How couldn't I find even a Bud Lite or Miller Light?!?!? We stayed for about 10 minutes before calling it a night."
1,"I got the exotice fruit crepe which was good.  It came with a scoop of coconut gelato.  I thought the geleto taste better than the crepe.  Its about $15 for a crepe here, which I thought was a lil pricey.  I think the next time, I'll just go to Paris hotel for crepes.  But the gelato here was great.  The coconut gelato had lil bit of coconut pieces in it and it was sooo creamy."
0,"I've stayed at MGM, The Hard Rock and at Palms and if you are going to stay off the strip, stay at the Hard Rock. Boy was the Palms hotel a mistake! Shuttle sucks, customer service at the front desk sucks. THE PALMS CASINO RESORT operates like it is bankrupt. THE PALMS DOESN'T DESERVE TO BE LOCATED IN LAS VEGAS. THE PALMS IS WORSE THAN THE STRATOSPHERE.\n     Twenty Four Seven restaurant in the hotel is the worst food and service ever. All they do is seat people and then you all wait 20 minutes for a glass of water. They under-staff their servers and the manager has hired a bubbly customer service lady who basically is there to smooth things over when the customer has finally had enough. When I asked the manager if he was a manager (big white guy in a suit), he pretty passively said, \""one of them...\"" Um, good, because I ONLY need ONE. When I began to tell him how long I'd been waiting, the bubbly lady runs over to intercept. Of course that is when I notice my waiter has finally arrived. Steak and eggs were 16.50 and rare. Canolly was bitter and sour. I actually went to the Mc Donalds inside the hotel instead. I have a meme that says, I came to Vegas and ate mall food. I looked at the food in the buffet and everything looked like cafeteria food. \n     I'm completely disgusted with the Palms Casino and Resort, and it almost ruined Vegas for me."
1,"My wife had never gone here until I took her. Me having lived in Florida and Louisiana I love this kinda home cooking that you don't get really anywhere else here in the valley. I LOVE the chicken and dumplings! They are the best. My wife likes the fried shrimp and chicken fried steak. The Mac n' cheese, the Fried Okra and the cheesy potatoes are my favorite sides. Their breakfast puts the boots to any other similar breakfast place. The pancakes are amazing, the bacon is awesome, the waffles are the best.  Plus on top of the amazing food you get to roam the Country Store while you wait or after your meal. Tons of old skool candy treats, and a bunch of stuff you would never buy but is fun to look at :) I love going to Cracker Barrel any time and have never been to a bad one!"
0,"when you first walk in you are hit with this horrible smell of....i dont even know what it is.....its just nasty...like burning rubber or something! for being a place that is supposed to create amazing FRESH drinks from wonderful fresh fruit.......it certainly doesn't smell that way! Also, their sandwich/wrap selections for non meat eaters is sad! The one wrap that they have that is vegetarian is just nasty...whatever corporate chef put those flavors together clearly didn't taste it after they made it! one choice?? that's all your going to give us vegetarians??? I know thats more of a corporate issue...but the smelliness of this location should be the managers issue...also the employees are very slow and really dont seem to give a hoot about their jobs...."
0,"Stopped in with a friend for lunch. The lunch special prices ($7.99) were what really lured us in the door. It was a sadly mediocre experience.\n\nYou get a lot of food for your money, which I was excited about. But when I started eating my Pad Fresh Ginger, I noticed the flavors were all over the place. One bite was way too salty, another bite was funky. The quality of the chicken seemed to be pretty good, and was plentiful. But overall, it just tasted unpleasant and was very greasy. The lunch special came with a cup of soup and an egg roll. The soup tasted fine, but was only sparsely adorned with vegetables. The eggroll was a greasy, bland little nugget.\n\nMy friend ordered the Ka Pow, which was equally greasy and underwhelming. \n\nOur server was fine, and the space was inviting enough. Too bad the food was pretty forgettable. I would not recommend this place."
1,"Don't know much about furniture stores, prices, etc. etc. So, I will say a few things in my limited knowledge of such places. This place is HUGE, and it's a lot of fun to just stroll through the store for 20 minutes if nothing else. I specifically came here looking for a light wood with metal king size bed frame, but no luck finding anything like that. I know our other bedroom pieces came from Copenhagen, (more expensive and seemingly a bit better quality), so I may have to back there and find what I am looking for. The stuff here seems very reasonably priced, and it's mostly traditional- In other words, I am more of a \""Bova\"" kind of Dude, and there's a lot of brown stuff in here, which isn't my bag. Overall, the inventory looks very conventional and reasonably priced, so I can't give them 3 stars, even though most of the stuff I'm not interested in personally."
0,This was my second visit to this location. I received a lot of food for my money but the food is just okay... I love Mexican food and this place is just cranking it out without any real quality. The service was fine and I did not think it took long to wait for my food. I'm passing on this one.
0,"Food is terrible! I hadn't eaten quiznos in years because I always thought the food was sub par and overpriced. Thought I would try it again. It is in fact worse than I remember. The people that work at this location are slow, lazy and unfriendly. Honestly I think they should give me my money back."
1,"While stealing coworker's leftovers from the company fridge and not getting caught might be an art form, it's not without its risks. Stuffing a large styrofoam container into the trash can is way too noisy and, it's easy to spot. This is why I choose\n grabbagreen.\n\nTheir leftover containers are the same containers used to serve their delicious menu items...a small, unobtrusive cardboard box. Easy to boost from the fridge, stuff into the trash without making any noise, and usually just enough food to get me to the afternoon break.  One small drawback.\n\nGrabbagreen only sells healthy stuff, like quinoa and kale and such. They're big on smoothies too, although I've never sampled one yet since they don't tend to make it to the fridge. I thought about trying Ramona's the other day when she went to the bathroom, but she's been pretty sick lately and I didn't want whatever it is she has. \n\nAnyway, I had some quinoa mixed with chicken, kalmata olives, red onions and red roasted peppers. Not exactly what I would've ordered but I'm not complaining. Miranda's leftovers, (name on box) were far less appealing. Way too green, looked like snot with all that avocado. Not sure what it was.\n\nSo I'm giving Miranda, whoever the fuck Miranda is, no stars for her obvious lack of menu prowess.\nRamona also gets 0 stars. Mainly for hacking up shit all day and not covering her mouth. I'll be lucky if I don't get some kind of communicable disease. Jesus H. \n\nGrabbagreen on the other hand gets five stars, but I'm only going off the quinoa chicken thingy I stole from 'Katy'. What little she managed to leave behind was damned tasty, but then she thought so too apparently. What a hog.\n\nI always hear the girls talk about how expensive grabbagreen is, but I don't happen to share their opinion. I think its extremely reasonable.\nFor now, I'll have to be content with them only going on payday. I hope Ramona gets better soon. I really wanna try one of those smoothies.\n\nThis place is yummo."
1,"I'll trade you one food city for one Trader Joes... I wish it worked that way!  My only gripe with TJ's is that there isn't one in old town.   I work in Tempe, so I manage to hit this one on my way home every once in a while.  TJ's is always busy, but the service is never lacking. TJ's employees are pretty knowledgeable about their wine selection, and have helped me find some great wines for super cheap.   My favorite thing about TJ's is they have a ton of vegetarian options and a rockin selection of hummus and dips!  As much as I love TJ's, the main downfall is that I can't go there for all my grocery needs, their produce section and \""staple\"" items are pretty limited."
1,"Great BBQ, and really nice people too!  One of the best BBQ places in town and not a dump like some of the other good places too!"
0,"Eh, in place of Debbie Gate's All-not so good grill.  New owner has painted the place, cleaned it up some, it is better but not a great interior due to how it was designed and age.  Some of the lights hanging as if on a construction sight.  Lights behind the counter are just to glaring when hanging out.  Really need to fix or cover.  \nThe staff/waitress's are the same as the prior restaurant.  Nice and friendly and do an OK job.  Menu has many types of burgers, sandwiches, salad, chicken waffles and breakfast items.  Every Thursday the menu includes Ribs.  Ribs were pretty standard ribs that are about as good as any in the area, had a little sauce that was sweet with a little spicy flavor.  Had a side salad of linguine with cheese, pepperoni, olives and a dressing.  Salad was OK, a little to cold at first."
1,"I'm stuffed!  No please, no more food!  Wait, it's free?  You just want to give me extra food because you feel like it?  Alright, I guess I could sacrifice and eat this delicious chocolate cake and free cookies you put in my valeted car!\nI swear that is how it is every time I dine at Vincent's.  They love providing extra treats which is why this place exceeds five stars.  The food alone is divine!  I love every item on their menu!  The souffles are to die for as well.  But they always seem to go above and beyond every meal.  If only every restaurant had the same level of customer service!"
1,"It was Saturday night we had just got done eating at a pretty bad restaurant and we wanted some really good ice cream to wash the flavor away. We looked on yelp and saw this place. It was a bit far from where we were for ice cream, but we decided to try it anyway. 20 miles later we had arrived, the place was small but inviting. The lady who help us was really nice, she let us try any sample we wanted and answered any question we had on the flavors. \nI couldn't decide what I wanted so I got a vanilla waffle cone and my boyfriend tried their red velvet waffle cone. They were both great! The waffle cone was so delicious, it was the best part! It also had an awesome gooey suprise at the end of the cone, it was a marshmallow that had soaked up the ice cream and tasted so good. This place was defiantly worth the drive."
1,"Been here three times now and will keep coming back. One of the best buffet values for locals and with coupons a good value for visitors.\nThe prime rib is perfect every time, ask for a thicker cut and they are happy to give it to you. The crab legs are fresh every time I have been there and they have several types of shrimp. Something for every seafood lover.\nThe Mexican food could use a little work, the enchiladas have been hard but they have lots of Asian choices and the American part of the buffet has always been delicious.\nAnd the deserts? Oh yeah! lots of choices with plenty of no sugar added ones for those who need it.\nThe servers are not only professional but personal."
0,"First off all you pushed through the line very quickly while they yell questions at you and continue to push you through the line.  Soup had cold and hot spots in it.  The sandwich was just ok, had better, the chocolate covered strawberry tasted like dirt, and the plain chunk of bread they give you for the soup was a waste, should of been a bread of flavor like Sourdough or Baguette.  Very disappointed.\n\nOh the ignoring signs they have on the tables that take about 90% of the table about not going to save a seat need to go."
1,Best all you can eat sushi I've had in a long while! Atmosphere is great- I don't think it's divey at all. Service was super friendly and the food quality was high. Definitely going back for more!
1,"We came here based on a recommendation from a couple of girls we met from Toronto the night before.  We were looking for a place to dance with good music and this was probably one of the better places I've been to in a while.  Biggest pro for me was the old-school hip hop and R&B -- they played What's Luv...c'mon WHAT'S. LUV.  Took it all the way back to high school for me.  And atmosphere and crowd were cool.  Despite the awesome music selection, Mme Lee loses one star from me for the mediocre song transitions, left me a bit disappointed.  But this doesn't take away from the fact that my friends and I really enjoyed ourselves and won't stop me from recommending this place to anyone in the area."
1,I took my husband here for breakfast for his birthday. It was very good! I had the huevos rancheros and the green chile pork was delicious! The rest of it was good too. My husband had bacon and eggs and he said it was good. The staff was friendly and we were served quickly. We'll definitely go again
1,"This place is great. They have healthier options on Mill, that change daily. I had half a chipotle wrap and a bean salad with sweet potato that were both delicious. They're newly opened, welcoming and nice. Also, the outside patio is within that little courtyard and is a nice place to sit outside when its cool enough."
0,"Items Selected:\nRed Velvet Cupcake\nCarrot Cake Cupcake\nCake Batter Cupcake\nDrumstick Cupcake\nGooey Bar\n\nLocated in a less than stellar looking strip-mall just off the 215 nearing the Veterans Memorial Highway and demarcated by a sign that simply reads \""Cupcake Caf\u00e9 Bakery\"" it was in acknowledging that dessert was unlikely to be a part of dinner plans at Raku that I stopped in to Lil' Brown Sugar and greeted by the smell of industrial cleanser rather than cinnamon and sugar on entering the door I nearly turned tail to the run, the festive d\u00e9cor and overall distance from home eventually convincing me to stay despite the fact that not a soul was to be seen until a young woman emerged from the back nearly three minutes later.\n\nUndoubtedly a mom n' pop spot, complete with pictures of the family alongside their children on the walls, Lil' Brown Sugar's menu is a rather concise collection of eight small-sized cupcakes plus a few treats priced at $1-3 apiece and opting to sample nearly half of the collection to the tune of just under thirteen dollars the results were a mixed bag at best - the St. Louis style Gooey Bar undoubtedly the best of the quintet with ample notes of butter oozing forth beneath a topcoat baked to a crispy flake.\n\nSitting down to snap some photos and sample Red Velvet that ate more like a frosted breakfast muffin than a moist dessert 'cake' before taking the glut of my bounty to the road it was just after dinner that I finally indulged in the rest of my selections and beginning with carrot cake fared featured good texture but not enough spice beneath sugary cream cheese it was finally in the simple \""cake batter\"" that could more simply be named \""Vanilla\"" that an overall impressive cupcake was found, the up-front sweetness serving to accentuate the vanilla rather than overshadow it while also pairing well with coffee, the same not to be said of Lil' Brown Sugar's signature \""drumstick\"" that returned to the dry mouthfeel of the Red Velvet as notes of what I can only assume to be cheap cocoa powder got lost beneath thick frosting, chocolate drizzle, and peanuts plus an off-kilter ice cream cone.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hedging my bets and guessing that some of the dryness delivered by both chocolate options was due to my late time of arrival and unlikelihood of items being baked more than once during the day, there are simply far better options for baked goods throughout Sin City and while some may think that cupcakes are entirely pass\u00e9 a simple look at the business generated at Sprinkles, Retro, and Gimme Some Sugar will clearly indicate otherwise...the fact is that Lil' Brown Sugar simply isn't that good."
1,The food is absolutely spectacular. I love the decor and the prices are reasonable. The only reason I leave off one star is because some of the waitresses aren't spectacular. I also get very annoyed with picking up food. The hostess will tell me 15 minutes and it will take longer than 30. I even leave late expecting the long wait and will still have to sit around for a few minutes for it. Every once in a while they forget the miso soup too.
0,"Let me start by saying that I have not eaten here. My review is purely based on my inability to reach anyone to place a delivery order. \n\nBased on the wonderful reviews and a friends recommendation, I was so excited to try King Wong and loved the idea that they deliver! I tried for TWO hours to reach someone to place an order. After many attempts, unanswered calls, and busy signals....I gave up and moved on.  It is unlikely that I would try again. Disappointing."
1,I have been coming here for years!  The prices are great and the owner is a gem!  (The rest of the staff is great too!)  Even though I haven't been in at least a year (I was flying on the east coast) she knew my name and remembered what I do and whatnot. ( I was never a regularly tanning person. I am generally very pale and usually just tan when I have a special occasion. Last time I was going often was my friends wedding 3 years ago....\n\nAnyway. She is amazing the prices are great and Its very hygienic.  According to previous reviews the beds are older. But I dont mind...  its not worth paying a lot more and going somewhere snooty....
0,"We dined here on a Wednesday evening around 7:30, no reservations were needed. \n\nThe restaurant appeared to be a nice steakhouse.  Prices were more on the expensive side, we didn't mind as we wanted a great steak!\n\nI would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. The food did NOT live up to the price and the quality was poor.  We started with a shrimp cocktail appetizer- the shrimp tasted old and fishy and the cocktail sauces were over salted.\n\nWe also ordered a salad, the $62 ribeye and asparagus. The salad was mediocre and the asparagus was under cooked.\n\nThe steak was horrible.  The cut of meat was poor, it was over cooked and was over seasoned. \n\nLastly, why would a restaurant of this category feel the need to charge for a refill on a Soda?\n\nOne of the things we love about Vegas is the dining experiences and love the different restaurants. We will not return here and I would not recommend."
0,"I've stayed here twice and the first time wasn't so bad.  I wasn't expecting much for the price, but we didn't run into any problems because we were staying in the newly remodeled north tower.  The second time, we arrived at 2am due to a chemical spill on the freeway that turned our 4 hour drive into an 8 hour drive.  When we got there, we had to stand in a huge line and right before our turn the clerk let a lady cut in front of us because she was having a problem with our room...Okay, but I just wanted to get to our room!  Turns out that this lady wanted a new room because the toilet was broken so they switched her rooms.  When we were finally helped, I was told that the King size non-smoking room that I reserved was no longer available and that all she had left was a king size smoking or a double queen non smoking...Yeah because they had just given our room away to the other lady!  But, being so tired, I was in no room to argue so I just went with the double queen non-smoking...It must have been the room that the other lady had just turned in.  When we got there, first of all you could hear the entire freemont street experience from the bathroom every hour.  It was so loud!  There were NO TOWELS, The bathroom floor was soaking wet and there was hair on it, disgusting!  And the carpet near the bathroom was soaking wet too.  But, being that it was so late, all the other hotels were booked and that we literally only needed to sleep for a couple hours, my boyfriend wiped up the water with a bathmat and we went to sleep. A few hours later, we were awoken by a god awful \""Bloop\"" noise every few minutes.  The toilet was making bubbles and that's where the water was coming from.  There was toilet water all over the tile and carpet, so gross.  I couldn't even pee because I was afraid to sit on the toilet in fear that I might bubble while I was on it!  The only good thing that I have to say about this place is that they gave us our money back.  So ghetto."
0,"I have been wanting to try this place for a long time.  I should have waited a bit longer I suppose.  The experience I had was not stellar at all.\n\nI opted for the breaded chicken salad after contemplating several other items on the menu.  I should have stuck to a sandwich from here.  When the salad arrived, the dressing was missing.  A very important key ingredient to any salad is the dressing.  With me being at work and on a limited amount of time to consume my salad on my lunch break, I had to rummage through the work fridge for some type of salad dressing to top this off.\n\nFrom the description on the menu you are to receive a handful of fries along with all the other ingredients for this salad.  If they consider this a handful of fries, I consider that they have a two year old working there.  I counted, and there were no more than eight total fries on this salad.  The breaded chicken was actually good.  It appears that they may make it on site (I cannot confirm this), but is was lightly breaded.  Not like the chicken tenders at most other restaurants.  Easily the best part of the salad.\n\nOne other shining star to this salad was that they give you a pita on the side instead of bread.  Giving you the option of putting the salad in the pocket and eating while doing other tasks.  But it wasn't shining enough to give this place more than two stars in my opinion."
1,"I like this store a lot! They really go the extra mile to make it nice.          Very similar to Sprouts. I don't know if they are owned by the same people or not .  They give you 10cents off your bill for everyone of your forever bags that you bring in. That is the best deal i know of. Plus, they even have coffee out if you would like a sample. While shopping.     They have a deli which only provides Boar's Head. Which is a very good thing. No additves and GMO in it.   they will cut your meat and cheese any thickness you like and they put paper inbetween each slice. Which is a wonderful thing.   They even have Organic wine for a very good price.    Very many good things at this store , and well worth the visit."
0,"I am just now getting around to writing this review almost a year later but the experience I had at this place still sticks out in my mind.  \n\nCame here with a group of girls on a weekday.  We were told it was a big pool party so we got there at 11 am when it opened and waited in line.   We had to wait about 30 minutes while they let in a couple people at a time.  We were expecting it to be super crowded since they were only letting a few in at at a time.  It was super hot (which is fine since it was Las Vegas in June) but the guy at the door kept giving us the run around about why we couldn't just go in.   \n\nWe finally got in and there was absolutely NO ONE in there.   Every bed was completely empty except for two and only a few people were in the lounge chairs and a couple at the bar.    Now we had never been in one of these places so we didn't know we had to pay for a bed.   It was $1000 dollars for the bed which was crazy because there wasn't anyone there.    We did put our stuff down on the bed and were ignored for about 20 minutes until the \""pool director\"" came over and informed us of the price.   My friend negotiated with her and since it was so slow we could have the bed but we would have to buy drinks.  My friend put an order in for 3 $25 dollar drinks and a bucket of 6 waters ($50).   We sat for about 40 more minutes and the drinks never arrived however the ladies that came in after us got their stuff immediately.  \n\nWe were super pissed so we just left but not without letting the waitress know how angry we were.  She played dumb and pretended like she was \""so sorry\"" she forgot.   I don't think they wanted us in there to begin with.  \n\nWe went out of Liquid and over to the regular Aria pool where we had a much better time.  It was very relaxed and the pool was nice."
1,"It's a lot nicer than the buses in the area in from, I'll give it that haha. The Deuce comes with nicer than usual bus drivers and even some attendants towards the front who help you get around. There are display screens and announcements that also make it clear as to where you should get on and off. It's double Decker, which we really loved, it gives you a nice view of the strip and makes you feel like you're on a tour haha. Its clean and nice looking. I recommend getting the 24 or even the 48 hour passes, it really makes it easy for you to get up and down the strip and over to Fremont St. My only gripe is that finding the ticket kiosks is confusing, they're not at every stop and the stops that they're at, they're not always visible, but overall I'm very glad that we had this as a transportation option :-)"

0,"Terrible customer service!! Went in at 7:30 in the morning and it was not busy at all. Staff was very unfriendly and quick to just point you in the direction of items we were looking for and then turn around and go back to their task or paperwork. Not helpful!! Lynn was the only one that was pleasant enough to speak with us and offer advice on a project we are working on. Everyone else was just walking by, head down, moving slow. Perhaps they need to offer their staff COFFEE to WAKE them UP at their morning meeting! Oh, and take some happy pills while you're at it, too!\n\nSelection on what we needed was poor, too!\n\nAND they cut my key wrong a few days ago. I ended up going to a Lowes near my work...Happy Valley. The customer service at the Happy Valley location was far superior and what I expected from them. Go to the Happy Valley location for excellent customer service...Ryan was super helpful in the key department!!! For something so small as getting a key re-cut, you could tell he cared about his customers!"
0,"I really want to believe that a cute little place that sells cupcakes magically whisks you away to another cream filled universe glittery and sparkly, alas, it is not to be. Actually, in reality, it seems to be too much effort to actually offer any customer service at all. I am planning a wedding and I thought I would get cupcakes from here instead of a cake. At $6.00 a cake (twice the amount in store) I figured what the ever let's do it right. I emailed them. and again. and finally called, the girl that answered the phone..ahem..went a lil somethin like this, hit it! \"" O yeah, well, like, the manager, she is like, not here. She is like the ONLY person that can answer any questions, So like. you are gonna have to call back, I CANT help you, at all..click.\"" end scene. AWESOME!! I am so glad that even after that I went further again and emailed, and finally got a generic return email, not answering any of my questions or even acting intrested in the fact that it would be over $2,000 in sales to them. OVER IT!! Its not even like they are that good AT ALL. So I will looking into yelp for a bakery cause the cupcakery is not cutting it."
0,"Park anywhere else but here. Tth Street Ripoff.\n\nComplete ripoff and they charge the maximum daily rate regardless of how long you actually park there. I asked the lot \""cashier\"" to do the math on how much 90 minutes cost at $2.00/20 minutes and he just kept pointing at the sign, telling me it was $14 in broken English.  Ridiculous.  He just kept pointing and saying over and over , \""14, 14 dollars.\""  \n\nNever again.  Walk a few more steps and park at one of the $6 surface lots all day for less than half the cost."
1,My daughter loves the lesson by the teacher. Also she loves the summer camp. She already asked me to sign in the camp in this Phoenix Music Lessons.
1,"When it comes to the dim sum: Har gow, shiu mai, sesame balls, chicken feet, pai guat, mango puddng, and all that other stuff of deliciousness, this is probably one of the cleaner, more efficient places I've been to. It's small so it's not chaotic. Plenty of food to go around and order. \n\nFor a chinese restaurant, the service is pretty decent. People are attentive enough to notice that a cart moving around isn't enough to meet all your needs... If you want to order off the menu, they got some pretty decent choices too.\n\nFor food, convenience, service, cleanliness, 4-stars."

The woman at the window told me it was perfectly fine. Ok so I get home and something told me to look at my burger and low and behold my bread is moldy. And no it was not just burned bread! I threw it away and will never, ever, go back to this place. Thats what i get for wanting some fast food. BEWARE! These people are going to get someone sick and they are lucky I did not ingest any of this B*llsh*t! Fyi... Dont waste your money, time, or health here!!!! DO NOT EAT HERE!"
0,"Very boring pizza, if you don't like garlic, oregano, any spices, and think ketchup is pretty good then this is the spot for you."
0,"The 2 problems with this buffet are the lack of transparency about their prices & dining hours & the over hype about their food. Do they post their prices & hours for lunch, dinner? NO. Can you believe the yelp reviews here? NO\nMy partner & I read the reviews & had dinner here Thursday Sept 28. We used our Total Rewards card & the bill for the 2 of us with tax was over $82. Reviews mostly don't know what they talking about. 1 review here said beer & wine complimentary with dinner. No, not true. Other review said they have 3 types of crab with even separate section for claws. No, not true. The crab legs are OK but were kind of salty. The salad selection is lacking in variety. Most small portions are OK. The staff is friendly. Bottom line: would we come back? NO"
0,"Close to work yet I think I will keep walking.  I've been there for breakfast and lunch and it's ok.  I tried their spicy peanut slaw, and all you can taste is sriracha and nothing else, bleh!  I couldn't eat it, it was not flavorful just a burning heat. Sandwiches are ok, nothing to really jump and down about."
1,"Great burgers, great beers. Never disappointed. & if you get a chance to try their black & tan cheddar burger . And if you're a mustard fan you must try their pilsner mustard. Ask for a side... You'll want to dip your fries in it! Believe it or not, root beer isn't very good there-too syrupy with no root beer \""bite\""."
0,"Just an update when I went back in to pick her up they did realize the over charged me and refunded me $10. The lady was nice but I still wouldn't use them again due to the length of time it took. It's stressful enough for a dog to go through that let alone taking so long. Clearly this is normal for them and I'm not ok with it. What is the point of having an appointment if you drop off your dog and they just get to it when they can?\n\nIn response to owner:\n\nFirst of all, yes a new client should be told it would take 3-4 hours but this wasn't the case or you never would've had my dog in the first place.  Perhaps you should ensure your employees are properly following that process before you make the claim rather than apologizing it wasn't told to a new client.  It is obvious from my initial review that was never disclosed, or I wouldn't have taken her there in the first place.  Secondly, had I known my dog would sit in a kennel or cage or potentially \""held down\"" as you so eloquently describe in step one, you again, never would've had a chance to touch my dog.\n\nAnd finally pay additional for \""express service\""??  Let me clearly explain to you that her previous groomer of 6 years makes an appointment, they take her in and groom her completely before starting another dog.  She never sat in a cage or kennel, she is accustomed to being groomed regularly.  They do not overbook themselves with so many appointments that pets do not receive the proper attention they deserve and are getting paid to provide.  So thank you for taking the time to respond but your response further solidifies my choice to never return."
1,"Love this place.  Great desserts in a great area.  The area is really cool, looks like they took a neighborhood, asked the residents to leave and turned the houses into places of business.  But nice businesses.  I'm sure that's not what happened, but it's a great neighborhood.\nLots of different delicious looking flavors.  I go with the ever safe chocolate every time.  Yummy.\nService was great and place was cute.  Check it out."
1,"This hole-in-the-wall location is perfectly lovely. Believe the hype, people. My Texan friend complained that their tacos weren't spicy enough, but I'm sure you can let them know to up the spice level for you. I love that they make their own corn tortillas (which are gluten-free, friends). They also fry or grill any meat of your choosing. I met the owner once to interview him for Best of CU for Buzz, and he was the sweetest guy from Mexico City. He recommends the authentic fish tacos. I love their pumpkin flower and corn fungus quesadillas and their chicken volcanes, but all their menu items are perfectly delicious. All orders come with a side of chips with two types of lip-smacking salsa.\n\nRather long wait sometimes, but just go at odd hours or endure the wait. They have an array of authentic Mexican sodas waiting inside as well. Seating is rather fickle and sparse, so get ready to carry out unless you're eating plus one. Enjoy!"
0,"Ordered delivery, they forgot half of the order. \nTried to call them to TELL them that half my order was missing - they didn't answer. Had to call 20 times until they picked up. \nAnd the food wasn't worth the price. \nSMALL portions, lacking flavor, not fresh ingredients."
1,"Great place to eat. We did order quite a few dishes - Mussels, crab cakes, dip, scallops, steak and chocolate mousse. Mussels by far was the best. Steak was not the best as it was over cooked.\n\nWill definitely go back. I am sure the outside sitting in summer would be great."
0,"This is a local/neighborhood restaurant that has struggled since it opened.  The food is so-so; the hours somewhat sporadic, in that the restaurant and bar closes whenever business seems slow later in the evening; but service is by far its main downfall.  The last time I took my family there, it was over10 minutes after being seated before anyone made contact with us; it took us nearly 45 minutes after placing a food order to get the food (the place was not really busy); and no one bothered to check to see if things were alright at any point.\n\nTonight, I thought I'd give it another shot.  Again, I took the family, hoping to support a neighborhood business.  There were 3 servers working, and only 4 tables taken by customers.  Remarkably, it again took nearly 10 minutes for a server to make contact or ask for drink orders, then a long time to get the drinks.  Again, no one bothered to check on us after the food was served, even for new drink orders, which we would have made.  Instead of enjoying a meal out, we wound up aggravated, with over-tired and hungry kids.\n\nOne might think this is just bad luck, but on both occasions, the owner/manager was in the immediate vicinity, seemingly oblivious to what was going on around her.\n\nAlso, beware, although the childrens' menu says \""drinks included\"" in the entree price of $6.00, this place charged us for the kids' milk.\n\nSave your money and go down Indian School in either direction  There are several places that know what they are doing (not meaning OHSO)."
0,"My experience was not so great. Don't get me wrong the facility is nice and kept clean but the lines are ridiculous.  They have 19 windows but only have 5 windows open.  What the heck? That doesn't make any sense to me knowing that it's a federal facility. You know there are programs that calculate the amount of people who come in and out of the facility so I don't understand why they can't staff accordingly!!!  \n\nThey also don't have enough seats available.  Many people were standing up and of course this makes people grumpy and cranking. Please consider adding more seats or rearranging the wait area.\n\nAfter the long wait we at least got a nice staff member who helped us out so I'm grateful they weren't a jerk who gives snippy attitude.  They were helpful so that is what bumped up the rating.\n\nMy advice, go earlier and have breakfast first!"

Don't stand to the side, don't stand behind someone, STAND IN THE MIDDLE! \n\nHaze, just because your new does not give you the right to charge ridiculous amounts, especially since you've lost all your earnings on those darned penny slots.\n\nAnd I did not appreciate almost, always getting plowed over by the bar backs with ice buckets, eek! AND thanks for making our five (by the end of the night, four) guys wait in line until we walked out of the club at 3AM. Yeah, thanks.

1,"This airport is a hellhole. It's like MCO (Orlando) in that you have a lot of people who don't travel often and don't know what they're doing or where they're going. But unlike MCO, most of them aren't kids, so when they're terrible at walking there's no excuse. Dudes: do not stop walking in the middle of a busy through way. Walk over to the side, just like if you were driving. Also, there's bright, ugly slot machines everywhere. The food is even more ridiculously overpriced than you might expect.\n\nAll that plus an early morning, and feeling adrift in time and space thanks to sleeping on the plane. I'm usually not this cranky at airports. I don't mind layovers, especially not short ones. But I felt like a zombie and was miserable.\n\nLuckily for me, I stumbled into this place. The baristas were kind. The coffee was excellent, and quickly delivered. The prices aren't nearly as exorbitantly jacked up as other places in the airport."
0,"Came here for a business dinner, we had a conference in the hotel. We made a reservation and were seated quickly. The service is very good here, no complaints.\n\nFor a Boulud restaurant is one doesn't quite live up to standards. I've been to others and they were much better. I had a pretty basic french meal consisting of a salad and steak frite. The steak wasn't great, nor were the fries. The salad was okay. The wine selection is excellent, at least I was happy with that.\n\nMr. Boulud was in the restaurant at the time we dined, I got to meet him which was cool. I expected the meal to be even better than usual with his presence keeping the staff in tip top form, pretty dissapointing."
1,"FABULOUS CAMBODIAN CUISINE!  \n\nJust like being on an exotic vacation tasting new flavors from top chef pretty platters in almost a Cambodian Museum .\n\nThis small restaurant is easy to miss depending on your direction driving here because the sign is only painted on one side of restaurant . Once you walk in you see a display of Cambodian relics including very old musical instruments , nick nacks  and visitor books on Cambodia on every table .\n\nOur server was very friendly and welcoming and understood we needed a little time to decide . \n\nI decided on the Loc Lak , it was pan fried beef cubes over a salad platter that came with  pickled green papaya and carrot salad , egg roll and steamed white rice . This dish was prettier than I can describe but it was also more tasty than I can describe as well . I tasted unusual flavors I never tasted before that were very good sort of tangy slightly garlic almost a mint flavor but not mint and a lingering honeysuckle note in my throat . The beef was very tender not fatty or oily one bit but it needs to be mentioned that it was a very small portion of beef my guess is two ounces . I also really enjoyed the green papaya carrot salad it was so light and fresh but also spicy , every thing on the platter was very light and fresh and a very nice meal overall .\n\nMy husband had the House Made Beef Sausage platter that also came with steamed rice , egg roll and pickled salad . This platter is a very generous serving of meat you get four sausages that are seasoned in a sweet and sour way and are very good .\n\nWe were EXTREMELY HAPPY with our visit and also spent VERY LITTLE the two meals only cost less than $20 we hope to visit again soon . Also a BYOB"

1,"August Henry's is a regular lunch stop for me downtown. Yes, it's still lent so I once again tried a fish sandwich. I promise I enjoy all types if food. I wanted to share that it can be tough squeezing in lunch here under the traditional 1 hour lunch window. Also anticipate the bill to be closer to $15+ per person and easily could be $20 if you do some add on's. \n\nI went with jumbo fish sandwich and a cup of soup. The soup was a cup of clam chowder and it was \""delish!\"" I could have just eaten a few bowl of that. The fish was breaded and perfectly cooked with a side of chips. I got my ever present coke w cherries added. I recommend this stop if you are lucky enough to work downtown."
1,"If you are planning your Restaurant Week agenda, put this on the top and make a reservation right now.\nWe had: \n1.  Pork belly appetizer.... the best pork I've ever had (and I have indeed had the famed pork bun at Momafoku in New York).  This was the highlight of the meal... the shaped cut of the apples matched the shaped texture of the meat.  Likely the best $11 you will ever spend.\n2.  I picked two sides instead of an entree:  mac and cheese (with pancetta) and chilled bean salad.  Both superb and actually, a great pairing.\nHe had the pork hash (?)  Also fantastic. \n3.  Dessert was the sweet potato pie with streussel.... but, for me, the star of that show was the homemade brown butter ice cream. \nChef Justin Beckett is doing great things, cooking with local food and has created an interesting environment.  \nGo go go."

0,"After a long night of bar hopping in the vegas night clubs, some comfort food was a must. After waking up at the crack of dawn we Yelped online for a korean restaurant and found this place which had  a overall rating of 4 stars. ABSOLUTELY WRONG! You know when you're very hunrgy and anything you eat tastes great, in the case of this restaurant the food just RUINS your appetites. I ordered the mandu-ddukguk and my gf ordered the soft-tofu galbi combo. Now I'm not sure if it was because it was 7:30 am or maybe the chef wasn't there but my mandu-ddukguk was absolutely horrible. The soup base had a strange sour taste to it and  ruined my appetite. The soft-tofu tasted better then my soup but still wasn't up to par. The galbi that came out was of poor quality meat, the cut of the meat was fatty and had no real meat. Being Korean and living in downtown LA, great korean food is 5 mins away, I'm not usually a snob when it comes to korean food, but this was just horrible. Stay away!"

My friend and I shared an appetizer and entree. I ordered the escargo, and he ordered the leek tart.\n\nMy escargo was bland. Bland Escargo!? Really? It was so bland that I scooped up some of the butter from my bread and put in with the sauce. It helped, but I was still disappointed.  \n\nThe leek tart and side salad, on the other hand, was delish! The balsamic dressing they use was to die for.  While our waiter came to speak with us we dropped the whole Culinary students thaang on him and he told us that he had gone to Le Cordon Blue....we got a good laugh because the pastry teacher he had transferred to our school, and we had fun picking on him.\n\nLater when we were done he gave us our check and told us that management would like to buy us a desert. I looked at my friend as said,\""It is my birthday, why not?!\""  He gave us the desert menu.  Creme brulee? Ive done it a million times, Cheesecake? Can get it anywhere. Souflee? Would take too long.....but, oh whats this? Roasted strawberries with a balsamic reduction infused with mint and vanilla, served with fog goat cheese?! I'm there.\n\nWe ordered it, and soon the waiter came out telling us that management would like to buy us each a glass of wine to pair with our desert. \n\nYes please!\n\nI don't know wines yet, (give me another year to start on that) but it was a sparkling wine that went perfect with the AWESOME desert. Woah! Those flavors blew me away!\n\nWould I eat there again? Maybe. If I have the same 2 gentlemen, and I would have to avoid the escargot. Hmmph."
1,"This is the closest Home Depot to my house, so I come here frequently to pick up stuff for projects.  Since it's the time of year to reseed the backyard, I stopped by yesterday to pick up some grass seed & fertilizer.  I can thank our two numb-nut dogs for this project......they piss all over the grass and the Labradoodle dig holes in the yard all year long, so guess who gets the assignment for the reseed?  \n\n40 lb bag of Grass Seed......check.\n\n8 bags of Fertilizer......check.\n\nThank God the other dog is a Long Haired Chihuahua, otherwise I'd be replacing the entire yard twice a year instead of just patching it up.  Gotta hand it to The Better Half and her selection of dogs.\n\nThere's not much to say about this Home Depot......it's a standard store.  The employees are pretty friendly and knowledgeable.  It's not as busy as the others in town.   There are self-checkouts.  The Garden area is large and carries everything I needed for this project.  Meets all of my requirements.\n\nI was in/out in 10 minutes yesterday, so it was a great visit.\n\nWill I return?  Of course."
1,"This location never really disappoints. The waitstaff is friendly, a manager always asks how things are. I stick with Outback because the food is consistently delicious. \n\nToday I ordered an 8 oz filet, classic cooked, medium. When my steak came out it was...just not what I pictured it normally looking like. It didn't have the dark crusty seared outside. It was thin. It was cooked about medium well/close to well, and probably due to this it was tough. The texture was the worst part because I get the filet for the texture. Despite the fact that it's not usually the MOST flavorful cut, it's worth the sliiiiiight loss in flavor for the tenderness. The classic seasoning & sort of crunchy seared outside completely makes up for the lack of flavor compared with other cuts. \n\nI am NOT the type of person who sends things back, however, my boyfriend confirmed my concerns by telling me that he didn't think it looked like a filet. So, when Andrew the manager came by and asked how things were, I quizzed him about what cut he thought it was. He got it right...8 oz filet. I told him I only asked because it wasn't what I was used to a filet looking/feeling/tasting like. He agreed that it wasn't ideal and insisted on getting me a new one. I told him it wasn't necessary, and if it was the filet I'd eat it despite the lack of the usual Outback perfection. Nope...Andrew wouldn't have that. He brought a new one. The new one was undercooked, but since Andrew waited to see the inside before leaving it with me, he promptly took it back to be fixed.  \n\nThis time it was PERFECT. It was thick like a filet should be, and was cooked exactly medium...red in the center but not bloody. The searing was precisely what I always look forward to at Outback. It was the best steak I've had in a long time.\n\nI was very happy with the way Andrew and our server Shelby made me feel like a valued guest and made me feel like it was OKAY to let them make my order perfect. I don't think I'll become one of those picky sender backer types, but it was nice to know that at this Outback location I don't ever have to settle for anything less than perfect. \n\nBetween Andrew and Shelby, this location has secured me as a customer and I will be back next time I want a fantastic steak!"
1,"Well I went to school here and loved it and I feel like I got a great education. It may be huge but once you find your niche you will do just fine! You just have to make sure you go to class and take good notes because most classes are so huge they won't harass you to come, yet just expect you to! I loved the Big Ten games and the energy of the campus. I would never have picked a different place to spend four years!"
1,"THANK YOU cool yelp eliters for guiding me to yet another wonderful spot. I've passed this on Atwood but it never stood out enough to convince me to take a night off of my usual Thai places.\n\nThe reviews all are correct - the food here is fantastic. It's super casual so it's somewhere I would go if you're really just looking to treat your taste buds for a low key dinner. I want to try ordering delivery, but the fees are such that I would probably only do it with a large group. Here are some of the highlights:\n\nTom Kha soup: this coconut broth soup is a favorite of mine and something I use to compare Thai restaurants because it usually doesn't vary so much. Monsoon Siam probably served the most unique version I've ever tasted; it was tangy and I want to say citrusy! I also liked that you could order mushrooms with this instead of the usual tofu or chicken. \n\nSun dried beef: ordered this because of a yelp review that claimed people \""sing praises\"" to this dish. After one bite, we were singing praises. It's sooo flavorful and not overly dry! A lot of food for $7, easy to share with at least 3 people.\n\nRed curry: spicy (be warned if you can't take the heat) without losing the inherent flavor of the dish. Very brothy, which I personally prefer. I got the tofu because of a yelper who said they don't typically love tofu but this tofu is an exception. I totally agree; the texture is sophisticated and it really takes the flavor of the dish.\n\nPad see ew: fluffy noodles! Great with tofu. My friend who ordered this was so happy!\n\nMy friend is a huuuuge Ha Long Bay guy, and admitted that Monsoon Siam's food is better! Can't wait to come back and try more!"
0,Average food - had the worst service last night from a young man.  We were the only table in the restaurant at 8:15 - our server was rushing us out
1,"This place IS really GREAT except for one thing that some people like. THE NOISE! We almost left, it was so noisy we couldn't have a conversation and neither of us could hear the drink special from our waitress. The noise level did get better towards the middle of our stay I guess if you are there during the happy hour you might hit them when they are busy and noisy.\n\nHowever\n\nThe food was good, I started with a little romaine salad it was only $3. it was good except for the apple slices that tasted like onions (that might mean something wasn't cleaned). My roasted salmon was delicious and came over a cold quinoa salad. I was surprised to find out they use high quality Scottish Salmon that only better restaurants use. \n\nMy companion had the cheese flat bread and the Pork Chile Verde and was pleased.\n\nWe spent much less here on dinner than we would have spent at many other places having a similar meal.\n\nI do plan to return but will wait for a patio seat where dining is much more pleasant."
0,4th time in a row that they screwed up the order. Waited 20 min for them to figure it out and get our food!
0,"Bad gym for a date. Gym uses auto ropes so no need for someone to belay at the bottom. To belay you have to take their class and then pay for them to \""test\"" your skills briefly. Tried to get assistance for 20+ minutes wanting to belay a friend and go through the hoops. Waste of time with 3 different employees. i have my belay card from another gym on me too. Whole point was to get friend experience with process before she goes rock climbing outside for her first time. Not very big. I would never come here or recommend to adult friend. I would recommend to friend with a kid, as the auto ropes are good for them. \n\nWould give 1 star, but 2 stars because its good for kids."
1,"WOW this place is one of the coolest time warps around! I can't believe I never knew about it!\n\nAs Norm R. said, this is part of William Bartlett's ranch dating back to 1886 with many original restored structures, some are brick and wood and one is stucco, and they all have that wonderful weathered old look to them that just makes you wonder \""if these walls could speak, what stories would they tell?\"" \n\nYou can peek inside the buildings and see the furniture, tools and stuff they used during the pioneer days and get a sense of what life was like in Old West Arizona. \n\nYou can also wander around the property and look at and even touch (but no climbing please!) lots of cool rusty old farm machinery, wagons and equipment, and wonder about what it was used for. \n\nI also saw: a blacksmith shop, a reproduction of a well building that would have been used in the 1920's, something that looked like a locomotive engine, a dairy barn, a cornfield, a citrus orchard, grapevines, a rose garden, peacocks, rooster chasing a hen, the cutest white bunny I've ever seen in my life, and 7 beautiful princesses in ball gowns and tiaras posing for quincenera pictures.\n\nAll around the property are educational signs with info and photos about the original ranch and what life was like from the 1890's thru the 1930's (when the ranch was at the peak of production).\n\nI didn't get a chance to take a tour, but I think that would be an excellent idea! The website says that tours are held Thursdays thru Saturdays, 10 AM - 2 PM, and Sundays 1 - 4 PM.\n\nI saw a sign that says you can even rent parts of the property for special events. (I gotta save up for a major shindig now!)\n\nIt's the perfect spot for an afternoon stroll when it isn't unbearably hot, and there are tons of park benches where you can just rest and relax. If you have kids they will be super happy to see all the cool stuff and run around after the peacocks. Just don't let them climb all over everything or lose them in the cornfield, and you'll be good. \n\nSo, so glad this wonderful slice of Glendale's history has been preserved.\n\nAnd admission is FREE!"
1,Red Velvet cookies!!!!! \n\nThe End.
0,"I absolutely *used* to love this place. It had such a large and eclectic selection for super low prices compared to every other thrift store around, but since their renovation several months ago, prices have been seriously jacked up ($1 T-Shirts are now priced at $4.99! $7 Golden Girls throwbacks are now $14! ~ Blanche? Something is amiss...~) and all the merchandise looks like bland, generic stuff you can get at the dollar store or a yard sale for cheaper. This place used to be my thrift store go-to, but at these prices and the change in the type of merch they place on the floor, it's only \""meh\"" now.  I guess I'll have to get my second hand fix at the Goodwill on Eastern - and deal with that parking nightmare... Gah!"
0,What can you really expect from an airport chinese place....really?!
1,"We really loved this place. The owner stopped by to talk to us on our first visit. She explained how they worked hard to build their signature sandwich makers and that they work with wildflower bakery for their bread to be made in the shape they need for their sandwiches. I would try any of the sandwiches on the menu - excellent breakfast selections. I had the #25 which was the ham, avocado, black bean, cheese and signature chipotle sauce. DELICIOUS. Plus if you check in with Yelp you get 10% off your order. I can't wait to go back. I highly recommend this place. They have been open for 19 months. Right on the light rail in central phoenix."
0,"This place is awful! Told the obnoxious attendant I only WANT A BASIC CARWASH 10 TIMES!!! Wanted to sell me \""future\"" services! Pulled out and went somewhere else."
1,Love this place!  Great service and good quality work. Drive from east mesa to get my nails done here :-)
1,This spot is really neat and was where Mr. Soleri was living at the end of his life.  Amazing sculptures and bells everywhere and a great place to see some of the interesting architecture such as the mushroom top over his pool.  We had just come from staying a night at Arcosanti out in the desert for the solstice and this was another stop that we wanted to make before leaving the area.  Gorgeous stuff!
0,"So I was contacted by  Bobi L. From customer service the day after my first review of Smashburger. I was impressed, as I did not expect a response. I told Bobi that I thought it showed  customer service  actually  cared what customers  thought.  Bobi offered to send smashbucks so that we could try them again. I told Bobi that I did not write the review hoping for a free meal, but that  I would  send my address as requested  and try again. Needless to say, that was about a month ago and I have not heard a word since (and no smashbucks). Maybe it takes a while to process? was nice to be initially  contacted (but not since), I still can not see us going back."
1,"My wonderful husband treated me to a spa day for my birthday and I was thrilled with the package that he selected for me.\n\nI started the day with a Coconut Cream Body Scrub and massage. Quinn performed my scrub and massage and it was wonderful. I prefer to have a male masseuse as women tend to overcompensate and rub too hard. Quinn did a great job and worked out all the knots in my back. Ahhh.\n\nNext, I had a Custom Concept facial. I hate that I can't remember the woman's name who performed this service, but she had an amazing Russian accent. My pores have never been so squeaky clean and the face and scalp massage was wonderful.\n\nAfter having been scrubbed, massaged, and polished, I headed down to the salon for a pedicure. I had the Paradise Pedicure and it was very nice. My toes look perfect and Jessica did a great job smoothing out all my rough edges. :) \n\nI received a full grand tour of the spa and did also use the gym which had a wide variety of machines and free weights. Everything was in good working order and I was very pleased with the service and the spa treatment. I would definitely go back!"
0,"My fianc\u00e9 and I came to Baku for the first time on my birthday. The service was wonderful and food presentation was excellent. We ordered the pork dumplings, chicken wings, spicy tuna roll, and the butter fish. Everything was just ok. Asian food is my favorite cuisine. I have eaten at Asian restaurants all over the country and this is one of the lowest on my list. Maybe the chef was off tonight, I don't know, but he or she must not have been tasting the food. During dinner we even starting discussing what we were going to eat when we got home. Unfortunately this visit was a fail for us, and we may not be coming back."
0,"i ate here years ago, and unfortunately, they lived up to their name. (i see they've changed the name. at the time it was called terribles, which is how it lived up to it's name. i'm not sure why they rebranded and kept the same yelp page. hopefully they didn't eep the same recipes)\n\nit felt like someone took a chuck e cheese, stripped it of the fun and pizza, and gave it bad pasta as a consolation prize.\n\n\nthis review won't make a lot of sense anymore. when i first reviewed it, it was called terribles. why they didn't start a new yelp account, i don't know. if it's owned and operated by the same people, the reviews won't matter at all. if the food is different and good, they've screwed themselves."
1,"Fantastic 80 year old sandwich shop (see Risa D's review for more history) - If a place has been doing the same thing for that long, they're probably doing it right!\n\nDrop by when you're in the neighbourhood, find a seat at the bar (if there's none free, it won't take long for one to free-up), and order a \""special with cheese\"" and some pickles. There're not big - hey, the place is called \""Light Lunch\"" - but after two I'm usually good.\n\nWhile you're at it get yourself a soda - it's made with the syrup right at the bar there in front of you. I like the cherry or root beer flavours, but there are plenty of old-school options to choose from."
0,"My Bulldog was having some discharge coming from her eye and it was clearly irritated. I wasn't sure if it was just conjunctivitis, the beginning of prolapse, or something else? \nI took her to Centennial Hills Animal Hospital, as it is the closest vet to my house and that is where my dog has had her shots and she has also been boarded there before. Other than sometimes having to wait a ridiculous amount of time somedays, I haven't had any complaints about CHAH, of course I haven't had any major issues with my dog before either. \n\nI was shown into a room where I waited for about 10 min. When a vet tech came in, not a vet. I had to tell her what was going on with my dogs eye, when she proceeded to look right at her eye and tell me that it wasn't conjunctivitis and then tell me she would be back with my dog because she was going to take her in the back and have the vet do a stain on the eye to make sure there wasn't a cut on the eye. \nUm, what? So just like that, I don't even get to talk to a vet at all, and you are telling me what is not wrong with my dogs eye!! \nThen about 10 min. later the vet tech returns with a price break down of the high and low costs of the tests that they want to do to my dogs eye, but wait I haven't even seen or talked to a vet yet!!! Then she says also your dogs feet don't look normal so you should have us test those too! Huh? I am here for her eye, and I am just trying to see a fricking VET, and I am only getting a vet tech! What the heck! I told her I would have to call my husband and review all the costs with him. \nAbout 10 min. later the Vet, Brady Vanderlind finally comes in! He then goes over the high and low costs of the tests they want to do and makes me sign on the test I choose. Then he goes and finally does the eye stain. The whole time my poor dog was in the back probably freaking out :-/ \nWhen they are done with the eye stain the vet tech brings my dog back into the room and takes her foot and says are you you don't want us to test this, because its NOT normal! NO, I don't want you to test my dogs feet! I know what it is, and despite what you think, I am not a moron! \nDr. Vanderlind prescribed some drops for my dog. He said that if they didn't work she would have to have surgery on her eyelid. Of course the drops didn't work. \n\nI wound up taking her to Dessert Inn Animal Hospital to see Dr. Dennis Arn. He is a Bulldog specialist. I should have gone to him to begin with, as he has helped us in the past and he is a wonderful vet. I just hate that he is so far away. Lesson learned! I don't care how far I have to drive! It is worth the drive, to see a vet and not a vet tech and not to be hustled and harassed about stuff you are not even there for!! Not to mention you get quality vet care the first time, every time! \nDr Arn was able to help my dog and guess what, she doesn't need surgery.... amazing!!"
0,"If you believe the 5 star reviews on this dive, you are \""El Schmucko Supremo!\"" NOW I am truly convinced that yelpers in the Tempe area either have no taste buds or give 4 to 5 stars to immigrant restaurant owners out of patronizing liberal sympathy. What is wrong with you people??? This is a filthy little luncheonette serving up chicken that is too dry to swallow and beef that is so tough you can't even chew it! They give you a little salsa on your plate and charge you for tiny pre-filled cups if you want any extra. The woman behind the counter was utterly unfriendly and did nothing but jabber in Spanish with the cook, caring nothing about whether I was happy with my food or needed anything else. This place does NOT qualify as a restaurant, Mexican or otherwise. \n\nThe lack of authentic non-chain Mexican food in Arizona, particularly Tempe, is shameful, tragic and  pathetic. What disappoints all newcomers to Arizona is finding out that the state's proximity to Mexico and its large Mexican-American population has NOT resulted in it being a place where one can find great Mexican food."
0,"I've been to fabulous Freddy's a few times and I'm never satisfied with the job they do. Half of the time the inside of my car doesn't look like they even wiped it down. The VIP wash isn't a VIP wash! I've said something twice to the manager and they go back through but it still doesn't look as good as it should. I bought a book of washes because they were having buy 8 get 3 free ( or something like that) before I even tried them out. I should have done a test run to see if they were good.  They are right around the corner from my house so it's very convenient. It's very frustrating that the people who work there go through the motions of cleaning it but it's not actually getting clean-- Puzzling to me!!!  I always end up coming home to clean it myself.  At least the outside, windows and vacuuming is done. I have to wipe down the inside every time."
1,"As if the fact that this locksmith is located in a castle wasn't great enough, these guys actually know what they are doing too!  Here's a little life lesson: you will spend 1.97 per key copy at Lowes and only 1.50 at Genes. Here's the difference; the guys at Genes are real locksmiths and actually know how to cut keys...that work the first time!\n\nDon't get suckered into the whole convenience aspect of going to Lowes, Home Depot or other big box stores with untrained employees. The time you spend going back and forth with improperly made keys just doesn't make sense; especially when you are paying more for each copy. \n\nI had five keys made at Genes yesterday; all five work perfectly. The five that were made at Lowes...none of them worked! What a waste of time. \n\nBesides expert key copying this company has everything and anything relating to locks and security. If it has, needs or can be outfitted with a lock, these guys have it or can get it. The storefront is huge compared to most locksmiths and one can spend a good hour in here just looking at all of the cool stuff.\n\nI also inquired about their locksmith services outside of the shop. The rates are quite reasonable with a 65 dollar trip charge plus a few bucks to re-key your lock cylinders. Not a bad deal considering I have never seen a professional trade charge anything less than 100-120 per trip charge.\n\nHighly recommended for quality service, good rates, and a unique building."
0,"Overly sentimental, non stop references to her kids, how blessed she is, and her husband.... too many covers from elite performers like Stevie Wonder.... Billy Joel...Tina Turner.  Why is she not just playing her music.. as an elite performer herself?  A weird duet sung between herself and a computer generation of herself... and then back to back with another one...a computer generated Stevie Wonder this time -  so cheesy.   Horrible, phoned in attempt at being humorous and connecting with audience between songs- while an enormous projection of her face is made on the curtain- to see her \""funny\"" facial expressions.  (Kind of like end of Wizard of Oz.)  Still has that great voice.    \n\nI would have giggled my way through the show laughing at it---- save for the totally aggressive Canadian fans sitting near me.  ... like Red Sox fans.   I just totally don't get the show.  It's like a parody of a real show..."
0,"While in Phoenix for a long weekend I read here on Yelp that I just couldn't miss MADE. Well, I checked the website for store hours and planned accordingly. We were staying in Scottsdale so planned to hit up downtown Phoenix and the boutique on Monday before heading back to San Diego. \n\nThe website said it opened at noon on Mondays so we took our time getting breakfast and wandering about, which was neat since the neighborhood around the boutique is really interesting and has lots of great urban decay and murals and other funky little storefronts. \n\nWell, noon rolls around and they haven't opened yet. 12:15 rolls and no sign of life, so I call the number on the website. The recording says they open at 11 on Mondays, which made us wonder even more. So eventually we wander up to the door and see a tiny little note that says January hours: Wednesday-[whatever]. So needless to say, we were a bit irritated once we finally got on the road without having seen the inside of the place.\n\nThe website and phone message didn't even match each other, but you'd think if you wanted customers to come to your store during business hours, you'd update at least one of them to let people know you weren't open half of the week that particular month. \n\nI give it 2 stars because what I could see through the window looked promising, but the lack of information dissemination was really disappointing."
0,"Unfortunately I need to downgrade my rating. I still think the service is great. Very friendly. However, there are some big things I'm noticing when I go back that really bother me...\n\nIt's increasingly cluttered and dirty. And most of the nail polish looks old and rancid.\n\nI get a basic mani and pedi here, which was working fine for me. Each time they would try to upsell me to gel, and finally I gave in.\n\nSo at 3x the price for my normal manicure, they told me it would last for 3 weeks. Hardly. 4 days later, the polish on my thumbs were totally chipped and there were lots of air bubbles that popped up. Being that I had French, the bubbles look black on my nails. So I went back to have it fixed.\n\nThe girl did a really sloppy job. Polish is too thick. My polish is already peeling up and it's only been a week.\n\nI already knew that their products are old so I would bring my own nail polish. But now I'm irritated because I feel like I was talked into gel and it only lasted as long as my regular manicure because they are using crappy old product (high probability) and the gel was poorly applied (lack of skill).\n\nSo, if i need something basic done for cheap and fast, I'll still go here. But if I need a quality job done, I'm going to pay a little more and go somewhere else."
1,"Fabulous place to stop for kitchen gadgets that are both functional and visually appealing- most products are cute and serve an important kitchen role, though arguably the majority of goods here aren't \""needed\"" in your kitchen. They're fun though, and who doesn't like making cooking fun?!\n\nKitchenova is a great place for gifts, whether you need to attend a housewarming or just want to buy yourself something that will be fun to use in your culinary adventures. You'll find several options for popsicle makers, tons of wine accessories, and a lot of entertainment pieces. \n\nFavorite items here include the various novelty ice cube molds, gourmet tea selection and loose-leaf holders, and of course the BlendTec blenders- anyone got a spare iPone handy?!\n\nBonus points for being able to order in items from various companies. Kitchenova staff are friendly, helpful, and passionate about kitchenware. Grand Opening had several product demos, and space is clean, modern, and welcoming. I only wish I had more kitchen cabinets for all of the non-essential but awesome tools and toys that caught my eye here."
1,"I have been craving for some authentic ramen for awhile now since my favorite ramen house closed,,so after yelping I decided to try this joint,,and OMG! what can I say it hit the spot and so much more!! their broth is perfect and not too creamy/fatty as monta.. It was just the perfect amount of serving and everything is just so good..I think the best part is that its location is so close to my house and now I dont have to go to Chinatown just for ramen..Im so excited for the weather to get cooler so I can have an excuse to eat it everyday!"

1,"I have tried chocolate martinis all over Vegas. My faves have been at the Wynn and the iBar at the Rio until I discovered the Chocolate Bar at New York, NY. I had Death By Chocolate and the Reeses Martinis. Not only are they tasty and strong but they also cost less. Only $12 each as opposed to $16 at the Wynn and $14 at the iBar. My only gripe would be that the bartender does not fill them up as much as the other places, but if you ask nicely when ordering, she will take care of you. I was told that it just opened last August. Can't wait to go back!"
1,"Really yummy, no frills Vietnamese. I had the veggie spring rolls and the vegetarian pho - both were delicious. The spring rolls tasted very fresh and came with a peanut sauce and the pho was generous on the noodles and came with your standard fare - broccoli, carrots, bok choy, tofu, and beansprouts and basil on the side. Could have used more tofu, IMO, but that's my only main complaint.\n\nGo up to the cashier to pay, $10 minimum and they do not take American Express."
0,"I can only write this review based off a one time experience that was an emergency.\n\nBack in December, my Irish Wolf Hound decided she would climb on a 4 ft counter and eat 2 pounds of chocolate. We didn't find out about this until about 10 hours later when she was struggling to breath and could barely move. I actually pulled out Yelp in order to find an Emergency Pet Hospital and this was highly recommended.\n\nI called at about 7pm at night and they told me to come right over after I explained what had happened. They took my dog from me and put her on a doggie stretcher. I sat alone for a while until the primary vet came back in. She basically put it outright, without her doing a long list of things that added up to $2000 that my Dog wouldn't make it through the night. I about had a heart attack and said I could not afford that, so she said she would be back and see what she could \""knock off\"". Next, her assistant came in and had basic things they could do for about $900. We had just made some big financial moves and even that I could not afford. The assistant was the most helpful as she said they could give her some charcoal, water, and some other things for about $300 dollars and that it would probably work. I agreed to that and they did the minimal things for $300.\n\nWell, the dog lived and made it through the night without much of a problem and recovered fine. I find it awful that I was quoted $2000 and told my dog probably would not make it unless I went all out. I would not call that very professional if the bare minimum was all that was truly needed.\n\nI give it two stars based off friendly reception and a very friendly assistant vet tech."
1,"I'd love this place for its relaxing garden ambiance alone. Go to the full dining restaurant and eat indoors or pick up a few dishes from the deli area downstairs.  The downstair area does not have the full menu, but is designed to get a quick take out bite.  There is a nice little patio (complete with comfy chairs and misters), which is perfect for lunch when weather is good.  No matter where you dine--the food is healthy and tasty, plus moderately priced. Check out their Jasmine Green Tea for something refreshing--it is perfect sipping for a hot summer day. The dessert menu is extra tempting, but I have viciously beat back my sugar cravings and declined to give them a try.  If I ever order a dessert, I will revise this review and add my thoughts.  \n\nParking is meh. It's old town Scottsdale, so good luck there. But if you find a spot, this place is near the canal and there is nice walking to be had after eating."
0,"Came here last night post Terry Fator with some of my favorite Yelpers. Kudos for the staff for letting us take over the patio. We were loud and obnoxious, so we all had a fabulous time.\n\nThe only Korean food I have ever encountered was the BBQ; who doesn't like grilled meats? Anyway, not knowing anything, I let the experts order. I for the most part had no idea what I ate. None of it stuck because I didn't particularly care for it. The beef nonsoup dishes were the best, although not memberable. \n\nI found the tastes to be either lackluster, underwhelming, or just spicy. Nothing that really hit it out of the ballpark for me or piqued my interest in venturing into Korean cuisine anytime soon or ever again for that matter.\n\nService was alright. We had to constantly ask for more silverware, more cups, more tea, more almost everything. I think this is mainly because we were the overzealous group on the patio. \n\nSoyo, more like a SOY-NO. Kimchi is not for me."
0,"We visited here for lunch and were somewhat disappointed.  My friend, a real German, ordered roulade, red cabbage and mashed potato.  The roulade was fine but it wasn't really hot.  The mashed potatoes were definitely from a box - not fresh.  The red cabbage was OKish but only lukewarm.\n\nWe probably would not return - would probably try Zur Kate, which is in the same strip center."
0,The place is nice but it would be great if they would be consistent... Every time you go the food is different
0,Really disappointed in this place. Was here for a business dinner so we were in back in the private dining room.  It was a fixed menu so perhaps that influences my review but there was nothing in the meal that had any flavour.  I typically expect when going to a decent place that there is some taste to the food so that I don't have to get my flavour via salt and pepper but sadly that was not the case here.  While the service was great and very prompt the meals themselves were very dull and uninspired.  Perhaps it was just an off night but others at my table also felt the same way.  With so many good places to eat in Vegas not sure I'll give this one a second chance.
1,Best veal osso buco I've had outside of Italy!!
0,Service was slow because of the crowd there to see the fight. Food was served lukewarm and it was difficult to get condiments or even napkins. Will have to give them another chance the next time I'm in Charlotte.
1,"As a new arrival to Phoenix from Miami, I needed to quickly find somewhere to cheer the Heat on to inevitable victory, as much as Pop and the Spurs are appealing underdogs.\n\nArcadia was the second place the wife and I tried, Zipps being the first. It's a pleasant, casual, sports bar with a little less emphasis on the Sports than Zipps and a little more emphasis on restaurant than bar. We seemed like the only people there for the game, everyone else was there for food. There's no sound on during the game, which for an avid sports fan may be disappointing, but is probably nice for everyone else. There's a cool little area stocked with toys for kids, in case you're a kid or have them.\n\nThe food is obviously why people come. A long list of big, juicy, gourmet burgers will present you, the famished patron, with a gastronomical quandary. The solution is to order the Spinach and Artichoke Dip to allow another few minutes of salivated staring at the menu. The Spinach and Artichoke Dip is pretty good, as spinach and artichoke dips tend to be.\n\nThere is also a suckier quandary to be found here. The short list of light, tepid beers on draft is a little disappointing. I'm not going to complain too much, but there's plenty of room for improvement on the beer list. All in all Arcadia is a fun little restaurant for the casual sports fan."
1,"Lindo Michoacan is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants to eat at just because the food is O-so-Delicious. The tortillas is the best tortillas I have ever tried just because it's made fresh. \n\nThis time I ordered the chipotle lengua (cow tongue), I know it sounds nasty but hey it taste good. The lengua came with rice and bean's, guacamole. The rice was good, bean's not a bean fan so didn't get it, guacamole was good. For dessert I ordered churros, came with 4 small churros and whipped cream. When I first came here I ordered the steak rancheros, I would recommend trying it. \n\nI would totally recommend this place to my friends and family and fellow yelpers. The service is great, food is great, and the place itself is nice and clean."
0,"After being admitted to this facility my elderly friend received a few days treatment and then was constantly badgered to sign into a hospice facility called Solari. She was told by TLC that she could stay there up to 100 days. Then suddenly, after less than 2 weeks she was told she had to leave...period, no notice. Once again the Solari rep showed up only this time she stated that she could only stay 2 days in Solari. Moved her the following day. TLC on site social worker was usually no where to be found and never returned her calls or the many pages the receptionist made for her stating \""I know she's here, I don't know why she's not responding\"".\nAvoid this place at any costs!"
0,"HORRIBLE! Where should I begin. New renovated rooms? Yeah right! Bright pink modern blankets, rug and pillows. The furniture is old and disgusting and looked like my grandma's. We paid an extra $25 to check in early to find dirty dishes on the nightstand then when we picked up the phone to call the front desk we encountered a lovely pubic hair!!!!! They moved us into another room and refunded our $25 early check-in fee as we were on hold for 30 minutes and the whole point to check in early was to relax! As we walked down the hallway on the 26th floor to our new room, we were overcome with the potent and disgusting smell of cat pee and were greeting with stained carpet that looked as if it was 50 years old. We didn't want to complain yet AGAIN so we went to eat at Carlos & Charlies' and ordered margaritas that had NO alcohol in them. Ordered nachos to share that looked like it had been dumped from a can and tasted like it too. When we asked if there was alcohol, the waitress says \""yeah, I think so\"" ...and walked away. WOW. No tip for you! Then back to the room where we discovered there was a whole gang of children screaming at the top of their lungs and jumping on beds in the room we shared an adjoining door with. Enough was enough. We called down yet again and they claimed there was no rooms to move us as the WHOLE hotel was completely booked. (after waiting on hold for another 25 minutes) This was the manager at the front desk. We hung up and called the reservation line to hear we could gladly book a room as THEY WERE NOT FULL! We went down in person to talk to the same man we had spoke with and he lied right to our faces, was RUDE as hell and called us the liar. So much for relaxing! After an argument we demanded our money back and the finally agreed. I wanted to tell everyone in line NOT to check-in. Horrible experience. Smelly. Rude. Old. NOT remodeled at all! Service was horrible and no one even offered a free drink! What happened to the real Vegas mentality of service and keeping the guest or customer happy while we spent our money in their slot machines?? Sad. We went to The Palms, paid about $20 more and had a wonderful stay! \nFlamingo Las Vegas, you SUCK and give Vegas a bad name."
0,"Don't get alterations done once you purchase the suit! We purchased 12 suits for our bridal party and when my fianc\u00e9 went to pick his up from getting the pants hemmed, he found that they had simply folded almost 6 inches of fabric up underneath the pant leg which made them bulky and heavy. When he complained they agreed that it was not done properly and he waited while they fixed it, only to find that there were now large holes in the fabric that you could see from a distance. We had to get another pair of pants and definitely took them somewhere else for alterations. Also, when we picked up the suit it wasn't pressed at all, it simply looked like it had been lying in the corner on the floor. \n\nTerrible service, attitude and quality...I now see why they have to offer SO many sales for their stores."
1,"We've ordered delivery twice. Everything we have ordered has been great. New York style pizza, baked Italian favorites, burgers, wings - all delivered to our door and delicious!"
0,Super cool decor - terrible service & mediocre food. A group of us went here to try it out on a Friday night. We sat at a high top table & waited over fifteen minutes before a waitress even looked in our direction. Totally unimpressed...crossing it off our Scottsdale handouts.
1,"I've gone here twice now. This place rocks because: (1) great beer selection; (2) super friendly and helpful bartenders/waitresses; (3) basic food at a fair price; (4) pool tables, shuffle board, darts, loungey area; (5) tons of TV's; (6) location - right across from hardrock in the same parking lot as the new Kiss mini-put-put park.  This is my new preferred Friday after work happy hour spot.  Highly recommend grabbing a few cold ones before golfing at the Kiss park (locals discount- $10 to play).  Love it!"
0,"The food isn't horrible, but it's pretty underwhelming compared to the other options for Spanish fare in this town. The prices are also a tad out of whack. For example, the Chorizo / Filet stuffed Mushrooms are a \""medium plate\"" and cost $9.00, but what you get are three mushrooms smaller than a golf ball. I don't know how the waitress dropped it on the table with a straight face. \n\nThe service was polite, but definitely slow paced. (This, in and of itself, isn't a bad thing --just something you should know before coming in.)"
0,"Scottsdale Municipal Services truly suck the big one and swallow. We never received a water bill in August. Today, 9/5/14, we received a bill showing a past due amount \""due IMMEDIATELY\"" and a $5 late fee for a bill we never received. I called Water Services and was directed to \""Revenue Recovery\"" as if I'm some sort of deadbeat. I explained my problem and the woman on the other end became terse, rude and downright nasty. \""Well, we use the same mail everyone else uses so it's not our responsibility if you don't get your bill.\"" So I'm supposed to drive to where they print their bills and pull mine off the line? Is that it? \n\nThe conversation got worse as I tried to explain that it's unfair to penalize me for a bill I never got. \""Well, you can have it taken out of your checking account (for a fee)\"" Oh, like I'm going to trust this slimy bunch of perverts with my bank account and routing numbers. Like hell I will. \n\nThe end result is that I can take a full day of my time to file a formal protest which will go before a board of review to see if they can waive the $5 \""late fee\"". I know their time isn't worth anything but mine is. I guess they are really telling me that need to steal a plant from the park to get my $5 back. \n\nThere were a lot of ways the city could have handled this communication which would not have angered or antagonized me but the PMS Queen chose to speak in condescending tones and tell me it's my responsibility to police the US Postal Service. So I overpaid by a penny just so they have to post it as a credit. Next month, another penny and so on until I have my $5 back in manual processing time."
0,"I really want this place to be good as I live 2 blocks away from it this would be so damned convenient. The place is beautifully modern, It has plenty of parking which it needs for all the cars I see each day going in and out. My girl loves the salmon they have and the drinks are to her liking. My problem with it is not the wait time while waiting to have a table open but the service I have had when I dined there three or four times I have been there. \n  \n I will admit to the last time I went there that I got rude for the first time in my adult life with a waiter as the neglect and bad service seemed to be intentional and I took offense. Every time I have went I have had the same waiter. An older gentlemen who seems to have his share of tables which is the first problem but has a quiet disdain for everyone(never see him smile)mixed with the disability of peripheral vision, or is it a superpower?\n\n I don't have high expectations and as long as someone is fairly decent I will say great service but each and every time I went this guy was never helpful it took 10-15 minutes the last time for him to acknowledge our table for the first time( not after taking a drink order mind you). I wanted to walk out and became a little vocal. Yes he was busy and he was serving a large party but as you are delivering food to the table throw in a \"" sorry i will be with you soon\"" or jot down a quick drink order. So after that we get a drink order and he's gone again and we are invisible again. I don't know if it's some personal vendetta where he was insulted the first time by me still tipping 20% and that some how triggered a blood debt in his book but it was terrible each and every time. I am hoping when they expand that they will have to hire more staff and maybe I can get a lottery pick of anyone but him. To end the dining experience after waiting and trying to flag the man down once again I went to the bar to ask for the check and made it a note to mention how bad the service was.  That was the last time I went. \n\nSo besides the service which I do think is slow not on just his part but at the bar and in the kitchen also, The food is sub par for me and I have had quite a few dishes trying to find the thing that they are special at which I didn't find in my trips before writing it off. Here is a rundown of my opinion:\n\nService: 0/5 please fire him if you haven't since the last time I have been there\n(hint hes the guy the never is pleasant and looks like him, well not him but another actor with darker skin and green eyes who played villains in 80's movies):\nhttp://www.imdb.com/media/rm218601984/nm0001424\n\nAmbiance: 5/5 lovely place and would love to know who helped with the remodel, music was nice and mellow.\n\nFood:\nSalmon - 5/5 supposedly really good, not a fish fan so my girlfriend vouches for it.\nChicken and waffles: 2/5 my order of chicken was burnt, the crust was just a hard shell of black/brown dough, the waffles were nice though.\nskirt steak: 2/5 like someone dropped a bottle of pepper on accident on it, been a while that is all I remember I think it came with some potatoes that were ok\ncheese curds: 2/5 ours were soggy,and had a pool of grease at the bottom but the ones with crisp were good.\nroasted garlic: 3/5 actually not too bad but terrible on the stomach \nI had a couple other favorites but never tried the pork sandwich which is known to be great.\nHome-made ginger ale: 0/5 is strong and terrible"
0,"It's so promising. Great specials. Awesome space. TV's everywhere. Full bar. Good food. Great place to grab some beers before and after a spring training game.\n\nBut service sucks. I don't understand why I have to be carded at the door, carded at the table, then carded at the bar. There were 3 groups in the entire place, and we still got slow and crappy service. \n\nI wish I had better things to say. But really.... the experience completely sours the good things about this place."
0,"I will not be caught in this place alone ordering past 8 pm. The strip mall where it's located is a bit dubious. The restaurant itself is dark and dingy. Their salsa station always looks messy.Talking to the cashier on night shift is like talking to a robot. No attempt at customer service whatsoever. There are so many things they can improve upon. \n\nIt's a shame because their tacos are decent with enough flavor and spices to hit the spot. This place is also open 24/7! From where I live, this is closer than having to venture out to downtown/strip to Tacos El Gordo. So if I have a taco craving, Roberto's can *sometimes* suffice, especially when pressed for time. I just order their adobada, carne asada, and fish tacos."
0,If I could give them negative starts i would. Worst customer service I have ever experienced.
0,"i got to stay here TWICE because of work - i really cant complain about it but when your boss is staying at the venetian, IT IS A REASON TO COMPLAIN.\n\nyou get hotel envy.\n\nfor the most part, I HATE THE FACT THAT THE CASINOS, THE BAR, CANTERS DELI, and MIST BAR is just PLAIN DREARY. its like all the fuglies and the losers of vegas are here. UGH.\n\ni ended up going to christian audigier nightclub because my other friends were in town - its not a bad club, its pretty okay, i believe. no cover for hotel guests just made me go. hahaha. (that and i had to wake up at 6am to get ready for work)\n\nmy room was okay, the king size bed was nice and comfy and the nice people at the front desk put me in a low floor near the elevator room. i love the fact that i was there because the last time i stayed my room was at the end of nowhere - working 12 hour days and walking a block and a half from the elevator to my room is no joke. (and no, i didnt mind that i had a view of the airconditioning unit of the hotel)\n\nsadly the remote control and the tv was retarded AND THE HOTEL ROOM HAD NO FRIDGE. (weird)\n\nthe TOILETRIES SUCK BIG TIME, seems to me that its the same brand that budget hotels use just in a different container.\n\nthe bellboy who took my luggage at the belldesk WAS EXPECTING A TIP WHEN HE DIDNT EVEN TAKE THE THING FROM MY ROOM. really? what a dick. a tip for writing my name on a claim tag and chatting a little bit? (acting like a prostitute much?) \n\nid probably stay here again next  year because im not paying for my stay, but if i was, id rather go somewhere else.\n\nthere is definitely no treasure in this island. LOL"
1,"I lived near this place for ever... and never tried it.  My friend is a breakfast-fiend so we decided to have a go at it one day.  We've been back several times since.  The food here is incredible.  \n\nFirst - the namesake - the biscuits here are perfect.  Very light and fluffy and always warm.  \n\nSecond - The rest of the story.  I'm actually allergic to much of breakfast, so I stick to the lunch menu.  I have never been disappointed with anything I've ordered from this place.  In fact they are currently the top runner for best Reuben and best Turkey Melt in the city.  The portion size is pretty spot on.  Although I think they could give more in their sides (fries, rings, etc.).  I usually order a biscuit as well and leave very satisfied.\n\nIt's very much a breakfast and lunch place so its hours can be awkward."
0,Not bad food. Environment feels dirty though.
0,"So me and some  friend went to this I hop today. I have the worst service I have ever had in my life. My friend had to wait about 20 more minutes for his food to come while we had ours ready. I had to remind the waiter that there was still an order missing. He brought it right away so we could tell it had been ready all along. He just forgot it. He didn't ask my other friend what kind of sauce she would like for her chicken. He didn't bring us syrup for our pancakes until much later. It felt like he wasn't all there. The wrost thing that happened was he didn't let us pay at the front so we could all split our tabs. Because of this,  he confused our payments and i ended up paying more than i should have. He was unprofessional and seemed like it was his first day at the job. I think he shouldve comped one of the meals to make up for the mistakes. Me and my friends are not satisfied with that waiter and it has made us not want to go to that location anymore."
0,"Wanted to get a locket engraved.  Called ahead to get hours of engraver.  Was told he worked Wed-Sat.  Drove from Green Valley to this store's location on Saturday.  When we arrived we were told \""the engraver is off today\""!  He is the only one who can look at this piece and say whether or not he can engrave it.  We returned on Wed and he was there.  The lady in front indicated for us to come with her into the back.  We were immediately shooed out to the front by the engraver who said he would look at the piece out there.  He said he could do it and told us to come back Friday to pick it up.  The sales/customer rep did up our ticket and this was a feat as she was new and needed help to complete the task.  On Friday we were on this side of town and called to let them know we were on our way to pick it up.  The person who answered the phone said it was not done yet.  We told her we would be there within a half hour and would pick the locket up whether it was done or not.  When we arrived low and behold it was done.  Keep in mind this was not a big job.  Six letters engraved by machine.  The job that was done was so-so.  One side fit well and the other side looked like the last letter was falling off the edge of the piece.  Again we had the misfortune of having the new worker complete our transaction.  My husband wished he had the exact change as he would not have had to endure her bumbling attempts at giving us a receipt.  I would not recommend this place.  Seems like small jobs are not important."
0,Many issues here. It took nearly 20 min to just get a drink. Then the 2nd drink took just as long and we informed we had plans in an hour before sitting down. Small things so far... But it gets worse\n\nThey charged me for drinks I didn't order. They spilled beer on my dinner. \n\nWhen I informed them of the over charge They ran my card twice!!! \n\nAs we got up they spilled catchup all over my wife's back and hair and on my expensive cowboy boots. \n\nWhen we told manager he said there is nothing he could do to make us leave happy. \n\nHe gave us a business card and said come visit again when he isn't busy :/ \n\nIt's an hour drive each way for us :(\n\nDon't do it. To many other nearby choices.
0,"A perfectly acceptable strip mall Mexican joint that happens to be next to REI, which I found particularly convenient on the two occasions I had to go there during a recent trip to Arizona. Just thinking about the homestyle dishes they serve here is making me hungry for Mexican food right now. You fuckers are spoiled in the Southwest, I hope you know that. We don't get cafeteria food of this caliber where I'm from. One tip: don't order coffee.\n\nOne tip for the owners: is the gigantic TV really necessary? Also, get better coffee."
0,"Came here after a pretty severe car accident and things seemed to be going fine for the first couple of months. I constantly told Dr. Johnson about tingling in my hands and feet but he didn't seem to pay too much attention to it so I wasn't too worried about it; until I woke up one day and couldn't move my neck either which way. He told me that sometimes after a big trauma that happens but still wasn't overly concerned- I told him my primary care doctor wanted me to go see a spine specialist: he balked and said that was absolutely ridiculous and that I was in the right place. Thank God I followed my instincts and went anyways because I found out I have a herniated disc in my neck and a ruptured ligament in my spine. Extremely disappointed that at no point, Dr. Johnson recommended an MRI or a referral to a specialist when symptoms continued to worsen. He just continued to act like he knew what was happening when he clearly had no clue. If you are just in for a maintenance issue then this place is fine, but if you have serious back issues then I would not recommend."
1,I love love love Red Velvet Cafe! I almost didn't want to write this review in fear of it becoming overly popular and having to wait haha.  My bf and I come almost once a week to get our fix. I'm always torn between the taco salad and one of their chicken paninis. I'm not a vegan so I get regular chicken but they are able to make it vegan if you are. The food is very consistent and comes out every time hot and delicious. The staff is extremely friendly and the owner is always there checking on the customers. Make sure you save room for dessert because it can't be beat. Everything I've tried has been great but I always find myself picking the peanut butter brownie. Mmmm!
1,I've had sushi from all over and Blue Wasabi is my favorite spot. Wish I had one close to where I live now. Any of the rolls are great and service is always top notch. \n\nSmall recommendation - sit outside. The lighting is a bit dark inside.
0,I attended a private event here and I thought we would have the whole club to our self instead we had to share it with regular customers too which seemed really weird.\n\nWhen I checked in I was given a special VIP pass and told to have a good time.  I was also told that there were special VIP areas for me that I had full access too.  The problem was that all areas were roped off but I had no idea which side was VIP and which side was not VIP.  I found it kind of funny because with my VIP pass every velvet rope was lifted up for me.  Yes that is cool but what side should I be on.  It was a little confusing.\n\nWe also had passed apps and the staff serving them were really nice but it was some of the worse food I have ever had in my life.  I honestly could not even call it food...Costco samples tasted better then this stuff they were serving us.  I would have expected more from a location in the Bellagio.\n\nThe bar near the windows was also really packed and I could not get the bartenders attention to get a drink.  I then spotted a bar way on the other side and decided to see what was going on over there.  I had to go through two Border Patrol check points (guys with the velvet ropes) to get there and still had no idea if I could get a drink down there.  I asked the bartender and she said sure...okay things were starting to look up.\n\nI will tell you that seeing the dancing waters from the backside was unique.  It is also a closer vantage point then standing on the street.  My two stars are for the five star view.  The only thing I hated is that the non-VIP party had taken all of the best viewing areas and were clinging to the window where the water show was at.
0,This place was disgusting even my 12 year old did not like it. Everything came out of a box. We were very disappointed and will not return to this buffet.
1,"Overpriced but what isn't in Las Vegas?\n\nThe restaurant is clean, elegant, quiet, and a bit secluded from the hustle and bustle of the strip despite being on it.  \n\nwe went for a light lunch and had the margarita pizza. I love a good margarita pie and I enjoyed it but for my husband, it was just cheese pizza."
1,"pasty/past/\nNoun: A folded pastry case filled with seasoned meat and vegetables aka AMAZINGNESS! Yes, amazingness is a word. A friend and I had decided to check this place out, and absolutely fell in love. I ordered the Spicy Asiago Chicken Pasty: Spicy chicken, roasted corn, black beans, asiago cheese, hatch chilies and mexican stewed tomatoes, with a side of sour cream and salsa. If you want to add a lil more heat you can request some sriracha. They have a great selection of wine (I'm partial to their Malbec) and beers and their happy hour is killer. \n\nThe ambiance alone is pretty sweet as well. We sat at the bar, which is purely lit with candles. The tables are set with black church pews with candlight and dim lighting throughout. If it's a nice evening they have plenty of outdoor seating as well. Everyone that works there was soo chill and laid back. Made for a great evening ! \n\nJust hope next time I have enough room to try their dessert!"
0,"Just got back from spending almost a week here after working the POOL Tradeshow. First of all we get there and the lines to check in are insane! I understand waiting in line is going to happen in summer but you would think they would open more then 3 lines to get the line moving..but they didn't. We finally get to the front and there was a problem with their credit card machine understandable but this lady didn't say anything not a thanks for waiting or a heads up about what was taking long.I already got the vibe that this hotel was going to suck balls. Luckily we weren't in the actually pyramid which I don't even know how people stay in those rooms with the casino RIGHT below them.\nWe got to our room and our bathroom smelled like the maid had double deckered our toliet ( this is when someone shits in the tank and leaves it there so it permantely smells like shit) we even checked to see if one was in there. It was horrible but knowing how shitty there service was we didn't even bother to call to change rooms. Next thing we notice our beds have blood spots on them not just one a HANDFUL visibly on top. I mean at least try to hide that shit. We called for them to change the sheets and they did thanksfully..(costing us 5 for the tip)\nWe had a friend staying with us so we called down for a roll away but once again we had to be inconvienced. They said we had to come down to give our credit card info.. what is this 1998? So our friend had to wait in the long ass line just to ask for a rollaway. The rollaway came 3 hours later. They said we wouldn't be charge, wow finally a break from the shittiness.When we were done with it the next day we called to get it picked up and NO ONE came. We decided to leave it in the hallway but then this ended up costing us a 100 dollars (not so free afterall). Thankfully they removed the charge or I would have gone ape shit.The last thing that really was a pain in the ass about this hotel is the parking. It was an absolute joke it was as if they built it last minute thinking \"" O wait we have to have somewhere for our guests to park\"", It is small, most of the time we were crossing our fingers for a spot. Also it is a journey to the casino and when it is hot as hell out that really pisses you off.They basically don't care here and have no hospitality for their guests. I get it your rooms are cheap but I mean if you want return customers you have to do your job and be nice to us. This hotel also had a weird vibe in it I really wouldn't doubt it being curse. The ONLY cool part about it is that it leads to Mandalay Bay but honestly I would rather drive then stay in this hotel again."
1,"Stopped in for a quick lunch with my Mom and found the place to be quite remarkable. We were greeted warmly and told to sit anywhere. Ordered up tacos, two each, chicken, pork and carne asada.  Street taco size and very tasty. Mom had tacos as well and as this was just a way of killing some time we did not sit for a full meal. I will be coming back, soon as time allows to experience more of this wonderful little shop. Had no trouble parking right in the driveway. I asked inside and was told it would be alright."
1,"I loved my experience. My appointment was simple to schedule, on-time, and efficient. Compared to other medical offices, I appreciated the hustle their front desk showed. I'm sure some would feel like \""just a number\"" but personally I can't stand medical waiting rooms so I appreciated them moving along and getting me the heck out of there. Total visit in & out was less than 30 minutes. No complaints!! I'll be back."
1,"Affordable haircuts for kids and adults.  The stylists are great and are familiar with the latest teen cuts- which my teen son and preteen daughter appreciates!  I recommend you get an appointment or call ahead if you are in a rush, as they sometimes can get busy, due to their  great service and and happy kids that enjoy the games and fun waiting area.

0,We were here just now trying to get a table waiting over 40 min. They kept telling us we cant get a table because all our party wasnt here. we were party of 3 and only 2 of us were here and out of nowhere she seats a group of 5 ppl who only 4 of their party member in the restaurant. If u have been telling us that we couldnt seat becauae not all our parties were there dont seat other ppl whose parties arent all there!! Wasted our time and ruin the night.
1,This company delivers incredible service again! I highly recommend them for your home's plumbing needs.
1,"I don't care what anyone else says, this is by far the most beautiful shopping street I have ever seen. Yes, so on rainy/snowy days it's a bit annoying having to put your brolley up every time you venture out of one shop and into another, but where else can you have capital city quality shopping on one side of the street, and a huge big grassy park and views of the gorgeous Edinburgh Castle on the other?\n\nAlong the main street itself, you'll find all the usual big high street names like Gap, Topshop, Boots, Waterstones, The Body Shop etc and if it's a department store you're after ther's one at each at AND one in the middle (although Jenners is my favourite of the 3). \n\nThe best thing about Princes Street though, is that it's designed in blocks like in America. It's on these little streets that cut across it every 50 metres or so that all the functional/boring day-to-day things like banks, newsagents and estate agents are - which means there's more room along the Princes Street itself for the good stuff.\n\nThat said, there is one really, really, annoying thing about Princes Street (aside from the snow issues already mentioned): although it's lovely and beautiful with all the old Georgian and late Victorian architecture, it does mean that the shops are quite small and so most of the bigger ones have two or sometimes even three branches spread along this one street. The amount of times you'll be on autopilot and accidentally go to the wrong H&M for what you need, only to have to trudge what seems like a mile back along the road to the other branch, it's more than a bit of a pain."
1,"We've eaten here many times. The wait staff and excellent, attentive and the food is always top notch. The ambiance is cool and date appropriate."
1,"I'm in love with this store.\n\nPrices are fairly steep, but you're getting what you pay for. The quality of the clothing is good. I have bought two dresses from the boutique (one at this location and another in San Francisco). I'm super satisfied with my purchases.\n\nWhen you're buying specialty dresses, you're gonna pay specialty prices. The shopping experience is great! The girls are very friendly and help you find the right accessories and sizes. \n\nThere are gorgeous shoes, swimsuits, dresses, coats, pants, and accessories to choose from. The store is exciting just to walk through!\n\nYou'll love anything you buy from here."
0,"What a disappointment... In terms of food and service.  We also did \""\u00e8\"" a few months ago so we knew the gin and tonic would be good...which it was with its cool globe shaped ice cube...\n\nNow food... The only things we thought were really good were the veal checks.. Very tender and soft.. And also the cannelloni noodle with the pork filing.. Very rich but good.  \n\nThe tomato bread seemed soggy.. The croquettes (while served in a playful shoe) were only ok... The bacalao empanadas were like fried greasy wontons.  The asparagus was tender but only tasty if u dipped it in the sauce it came with which wasn't enough Togo around. We had a sample of the lobster paella ... The rice was dry and tasteless, lobster was overdone... So glad we didn't order it.\n\nNow service...there was some major disconnect between the server and other servers as well as with us.. Moreso than I have ever seen before at a restaurant.\nOur first round of ordering I ordered a dish that never came.. So when we asked about he he was like \""oh, I wasn't sure if you wanted me to put it in\""... Then when we said \""yeah.. We do\""..  He was like \""oh actually, well the chef wasn't happy with this dish tonight so we suggest you try another dish similar to that\"".... Ok.... But it was weird he never told us this.\n\nNext time he said \""we have lobster paella now but later they are making shortrib paella\"". We said we would like the short rib paella when it comes out..and then ordered some other dishes. Meanwhile a waitress comes by 15 min later with a plate and says \""the waiter said you were interested in the paella so here is a sample of the lobster paella\"". We tasted it and thought \""meh, glad we ordered the shortrib cuz this isn't that good\"". Meanwhile other small plates come out and we said \""oh is the short rib paella coming still?\"". Then he was like all \""oh I wasn't sure if you wanted it\"" and we were like yeah we ordered the shortrib... He's like \""oh but didn't the waitress give you a sample,\"". We were very confused.. He said \""oh the chefs decided to go with lobster all night and not do the short rib\""...  Ok.... Why didn't you tell us this when we clearly ordered it?? \n\nSo much confusion... So awkward... And so overpriced. The dishes were not that well executed and staff seemed not well-meshed. I thought maybe when we were seated at the bar before our reservation at \""\u00e8\"" that it was awkward that they forgot about us and we got seated to \""\u00e9\"" late (even though we were very early).. But apparently staff disconnect is a common theme here...."
0,"I hosted a large party of 14, employees and their kids, for a dinner at the end of a long week of business meetings. Our party was evenly split with kids and adults. We arrived at 7:45, the restaurant was very slow, but we were seated in a corner that would never have worked to seat our party. \n\nBy 8:10, we were moved to a larger table, but some of us had to stand for 25 minutes because the place they originally sat us was so inappropriate. I feel bad for the couple sitting at a nearby two-top that had a nice view of our butts as they tried to eat. \n\nWe had the chips and salsa, adding guacamole, and then cheese dip to keep the kids happy. The guacamole was ok for my tastes with cilantro and jalape\u00f1os in it. For out of town kids, it had too much zing for some of them. I can live with that. The cheese dip was melted white cheese (jack?) with a creamy sauce like Alfredo in it. Not at all like what I would expect. \n\nWe ordered, and the food finally arrived around 9pm. One of my kids was studying astronomy in school and pointed out at 9:21, lights could be seen streaking across the sky. All the kids went outside to the patio to see this phenomenon, but the men stayed inside and continued their conversation. \n\nThat's when the problem started. A busboy asked me in broken English with one hand on my plate if I was done. I said yes. My plate was whisked away. \n\nA few minutes later, the rest of the party returned to find all of their plates had also been taken, quite a few with significant food remaining. A pork chop with one bite out of it. A salad with a large amount remaining. A taco plate with one of two tacos eaten. \n\nAs a former restaurant manager, I can say with authority that when an unusual amount of food is left on the plate, it's appropriate to ask: \""do you want this to go?\"" \""Are they done eating?\"", \""was everything ok with the food\""?, etc. it should give any restaurant worker pause to ask under those circumstances. Apparently not at the old town tortilla factory. \n\nWhen the party came back after 5 minutes, the whole table had been cleared. Children were upset, adults disappointed. My wife approached the manager and said this isn't right. He immediately blamed me for saying I was done as that was good enough to take whole meals away to the trash. My wife said they weren't done and he essentially called her a liar. He did not ask the other adults or children in our party what they were missing. He wasn't present when I said I was done with my plate. But his steadfast commitment to the position of \""too bad\"" is really unacceptable. \n\nI am a business owner for a local business that often hosts out of town guests. Three times I have used Old Town Tortilla Factory for planned dinners for parties ranging from 40 down to 10. (Not counting this dinner). \n\nReading all these negative posts have an underlying theme: management doesn't care. They don't want to create satisfied guests every time. Their inability to resolve this incident has just lost them my business, and I encourage you to try elsewhere. \n\nTip to the owner, resolving this gap will net you spring training like crowds, even in the summer, instead of sparse dinner sales. Well worth the investment to hire leadership who cares."
1,"I have had breakfast here at least 15 times and have had a  good meal each visit. I find it hard to pass on \""Eggs Benedict\"" but  the  signature Benedict with \""special\"" pea meal Canadian bacon is always a little disappointing. The flavor is great, but the pieces of meat are usually undersized (about half the size of the English muffin).  My  wife always orders the gluten free blueberry pancakes and they are very good.  This is by far the best choice we have in Anthem for breakfast."
1,"I love Cafe Rio - the service at this location was extremely laid back. Visited after the lunch rush, so the employees might have been slowing down since no one was in line behind me. Employees did not look happy - but the food was really good!"
0,If I could give this place a negative star I would! I have been coming here for years the service is has done a nose dive in the ground!!!! The service has is HORRIBLE now ! Went there for take out when I got home the order was completely  wrong the one thing they did get right was cold! I called let them know what was my order was incorrect and went back to wait another 15 minutes for them to correct it. I told them that part of my order was COLD and they said they would not replace it because it was what I ordered and there  was nothing wrong with the food it was just cold.  The manger or what they hired as a manger said she could reheat my food  and to replace it would cost them money to replace it. I asked  for a refund and she was NOT going to give me my money back. Finally she went into the back and asked some other person what to do which he seemed to have so sort of customer service. He told her to give me a gift card for the amount of the of the food! What I am going to do with a gift card to a place I am not coming back to!!! When asked to speak with him she told me he was not the manger but yet he seemed to tell her what to do !  It's a shame I expect this type of service from a large chain but not from a small business  ! Sad to say but I will not be returning and I will be telling others so they don't get ripped off!
1,It's more like a spa here at ewc. There therapists are nice and friendly.  The products they use and sell are amazing.  They smell wonderful.  The wax they use is virtually pain free. I like this convenient location also. One stop shopping at Boca Park.
1,"I was scared of this place based on some of the reviews I read. We went on a Sunday with one comped lunch, paid for the other. Expectations were low, which I've now convinced myself is the way to go into a buffet. Then you either get what you were expecting or in the case of Cravings, you get more than expected. The day we went in, we didn't know brunch was a special thing. We received not only the option of mimosas, but a wide selection  of beer and wine with our meal at no extra charge. We stuck with mimosas as that just seemed the perfect thing after a evening out on the town the previous night. The pastries were good, better than you get at any free breakfast with hotel stay (comparing it to other hotels we stay at when traveling, not in Vegas). The croissants were cold but were flaky and not overly buttery. Almost the best I've had in the U.S. Bacon was warm and crispy, not overly greasy like typical buffet bacon. We sampled the Asian, Mexican, and Salad areas of the buffet. We liked everything we tried. I did wish the Mexican station had tamales, but that's only because I was craving them. I'm a salad whore and felt their more upscale way of making/serving their salad (they make it for you but you get to pick what goes in it) was a bit snobbish. It's served in these little bowls. Probably good for the average person. When I want a salad, I want a huge plate of salad! Delicious house dressing, btw. While we've visited almost all of the buffets on the strip, I put this one at about #4 behind the Wynn, Bellagio, and Rio (ok, a little off strip but I feel it still counts). We do look forward to visiting again in the future."
0,"Weird their hours say they open at noon on Saturday because at 215 today, they weren't open. I was on that side of town and wanted to grab some cupcakes, but they lost my business to the cupcakery."
1,"So I've been visiting for a couple days and. Was excited to try all that Scottsdale has to offer. But wow, I love the \""cowboy ciao\"" chopped salad. As you see, it's already been written many times! Dried crunchy sweet corn , Israeli cous cous, arugula, smoked salmon, pepitas, pumpkin seeds, dried currants, bruschetta and tossed in a pesto Caesar like dressing!! Wha wha?? Hashtag genius!\n\nThe service was really good and our waiter is very very nice."
1,"I found a therapist here at Desert Ridge location that is THE most intuitive therapist I've EVER found. I hope disclosing Alicia's name doesn't make her so busy I can't get in, but it's worth the risk. \n\nI've been a member of M.E. Since their first location opened years ago. Alicia is the best therapist I've ever had and I didn't review until I'd experienced her massages three times. She knows all the physical aspects, but her intuition is what sets her apart from any other therapist I've ever experienced. Each time I've been there, she tunes right into wherever it hurts and makes it vanish. She can make my body stretch and relax like I've never experienced, and I do get massages on a regular basis. I'm glad her schedule is late in the day, I can almost roll off the table and into bed (good thing it's a short drive home) and get the most restful night sleep ever."
1,"Since I heard this place was going to open, I've been wanting to go.  It's a museum about the mob.  And it's in the courtroom where the Kefauver trial actually happened years ago in Vegas.  What more do you need.\n\nNow I know, for what it is, it might seem a bit pricey, but if this stuff interests you, it'll be worth the money and your time.\n\nTheir website recommends giving yourself at least 3 hours of time to go through everything.  Make the time. Give yourself extra time. Don't try to squeeze this in with a bunch of other stuff.  You'd be surprised how time flies.\n\nThere are plenty of exhibits and video.  Interviews and pictures.  There are tons of artifacts for you to look through.  There is also a gun shooting simulation room which is kinda fun if you've never shot a gun before."
0,"Utterly underwhelmed.\n\nI, as many of the other reviewers here, was a guest at the W Hotel, and weary from a travel-day getting here.  My group of three came in fairly late, although not close enough to closing that we were the last guests.  It was at that point that I had just about the only pleasant experience at Otto - a kind and gracious hostess welcoming us and seating us.\n\nThe disdainful waitress who replaced her at our table seemed offended that she had to actually speak to us to suggest specials and take our orders, although she did do us the favor of leaving us alone and sparing us her withering glares for extended periods of time.  The tuna tartare was quite delicious, but the risotto was mediocre at best, although given the amount of time it took for the dish to get to us I would have thought it was being prepared with great pomp and ceremony.  Maybe they were preparing our waitress' dinner instead, as I noticed her eating through the glass divider while we were left forlorn at our table.\n\nI put it plainly to the hotel's Resident Manager - I will always be a regular at the W Montreal, but unless things change I will never set foot in Otto again."
0,"I never really understood why Doc's was so popular.  I personally find its only real saving grace to be the outdoor deck.  Otherwise, the prices suck (beer served in 10 ounce cups on special for $2.50 - come on), the food is mediocre, and the atmosphere is nonexistent.  The drinks are weak as well.  \n\nIf you're looking for a night out, there are better places close by in Shadyside.  The deck really is nice, but it doesn't help the fact that the prices are terrible for drinks, especially for what you get.  That being said, I end up here a lot because others seem to like it...maybe I'm missing something."
1,"Friday April 26, 2007, Friday Night Maxim Party at Tryst\n\nAmazing venue. As of that date, Tryst was easily the most impressive club in Vegas, hands down. My date and I had a table right on the edge of the dance floor and the water. Perfect view of the waterfall. We used Nick at www.vipnvegas.com for our VIP arrangements and the arrangements were immaculate. Bouncers were super friendly. There was a 3 hour line and we stood in the VIP line for roughly, 1 minute before being escorted all the way in to the club. Amazing sights, spacious pools, great drinks and we met so many great people. This place really set the tone for our Vegas trip. Our drinks were well watched and the hostesses treated us like royalty. The music was on hit and the people, the weather, everything was BEAUTIFUL. :) \n\nSince then Ive been back a few times. Always good times. Its been since 2009 since Ive been. Its time for a visit real soon!"

0,"Sorry to say but I will not be giving my business to TI in the future now that it is under new management.\n\nWhile there are great reviews about TI on Yelp, my experience leaves me rather disappointed. It should be noted that I visit Las Vegas regularly and I know what level of service to expect from a major resort.\n\nMy party and I arrived to find an hour long line at checkin which the hotel was not staffed properly for and when checking in, the hotel did not have the room type booked available and suggested that a rollaway cot can be delivered to the room in 60-90 minutes.\n\nThe mandatory resort fee included perks that simply weren't available such as VIP access to the Sirens show which I didn't care for it but don't advertise it as a perk if you are not prepared to deliver.\n\nOur original reservation had us staying two nights and when we decided to inquire whether a third night stay is possible and what rate would be extended to us, the reservation agent simply stated $199/night. Now, I have been in Vegas enough to know that rack rates are a bunch of bull, especially on a Sunday night during Christmas. I asked again if there is anything they could do on the rate and the agent again stated no.\n\nI took my business across the street to the Venetian at $208/night and if you have stayed at the Venetian, you know there's a world of difference there. Fast, courteous service from the Venetian but not TI."
0,"just awful.  i have been shopping at this location for the last two years and without fail once a week, i have to go to another grocery store to find the item copps didn't stock...  and it's not like i'm shopping for exotic items.  this week they didn't have arugula or blueberries.  last week they were out of cabbage.  the week before that, there was no flatbread.  it goes on and on.\n\nthe produce is stocked at all times of the day, so if you are shopping at 11am you are bound to get your cart stuck trying to get around someone.  additionally, the produce is NEVER good.  have you tried to buy a red or vidalia onion from this location?  they are *always* rotten.  we found bread covered in mold in the bulk section - the expiration date was two weeks prior.  ditto in the dairy section - make sure you check the dates of every single thing you purchase because this location is notorious for their problems with stocking and freshness.\n\nonce in awhile you get a checker who actually looks up and smiles and greets you but the kids bagging are just worthless.  i've had to trek back outside to find a cart because they are never returned in a timely manner on the weekends.  i give the bagger three recycled bags and they put 30 pounds of groceries into one bag and hand me the leftover bags.  seriously?!  i re-bag every single thing, every single time.  yesterday's fun find:  the genius bag boy put ripe tomatoes at the bottom of the bag and i didn't catch it when i re-bagged.  three of the five vine tomatoes split.\n\nwhat else?  seriously i could go on and on.  the worst part for anyone that lives on this side of town is that copps is quite literally the only grocery store.  i've been venturing out to whole foods, which is wonderful but expensive and a twenty minute drive.  but when it comes to fish, you couldn't pay me to buy from copps.  take a look at their mussels and oysters if you feel inclined - 95% of them are dead.  and forget about finding something \""exotic\"" like falafal mix or tahini.\n\ncopps, you suck."
1,"Very Busy location. Great food. I got the Kalbi (short rib) plate for my husband. It was a lot of food and he said it tasted great. It took awhile to make, but it is made freshly, so well worth the wait. Food was really ono (good)!!!!"
1,"Small Asian restaurant serving Thai and Vietnamese to Chinese flavored dishes. I went there on a Thursday evening and the restaurant was empty, the owner took my order and the food was pretty good. I also received good service and refilled my drink without asking. I had the coconut shrimp as my appetizer, a nice large shrimp dredged in coconut flour then fried to a golden crisp. I also has a small bowl of filet mignon pho which was quite tasty with really good flavored broth. My main dish was garlic pepper shrimp with vegis, it was good but for me the coconut shrimp and the pho was the star. All three dishes including and ice tea was $30. I did notice some cheap lunch specials there between 11am to 3pm."

0,"I had the serious DISPLEASURE of attempting to dine at La Cave in the Wynn Hotel, Las Vegas this evening. What a dark, miserable little dungeon run by trolls.\n\nI was seated by a very snotty, skank hostess who apparently had little interest in the answers to her canned hostess questions: Was I a guest here? No. How do I like staying at the hotel? Uhm, I'm not. Would I like a wine list? No, I'm not drinking tonight....still got the wine menu. Why even ask if you don't even care??? Robot in fishnet stockings that she was, I'm glad she got off her stripper pole at the gas station in North Vegas in time to come to work at La Cave and find me a wobbley little table. YIKES.\n\nAnyway, I was dining alone and sat at the table waiting for a waiter/waitress for well over 15 minutes without ANY service, water or otherwise. Waitstaff walked by constantly, still no service.\n\nSince I was on a tight schedule, I got up and tracked down a waitress in the kitchen area and politely explained to her what had happened and then handed her back my menus. No one cared and no one tried to remedy the situation.\n\nI wound up eating at another restaurant in the hotel, with great service. Sorry, La Cave. Your service was beyond rude, your hostess staff was dirty and I was happy to take my 40% tip elsewhere."
1,"Having moved to edinburgh 3years ago from a small town in ireland i had given up hope of finding the reliable, quality, local buisnesses I grew up with. Until I found this butcher.\n\nAn unbelievable selection of produce mostly prepared smoked etc on site. The staff are incredibly knowledgeable and happy to help often giving tips tricks and little discounts. Also stocks fresh eggs of all varieties and jams, spreads, chutneys etc\n\nFamously, two fat ladies lived upstairs for a time and reportedly supplies local Michelin star restaurants. \n\nCouldn't recommend more ernestly."
0,"Giving this place one star is way too generous.\n\nHere are my grievances about this pathetic place:\n\n1.  Myself and others were blatantly lied to that there would be no construction.  Two weeks in, it starts every night, all night at midnight and goes until around 5pm.  Be prepared for constant loud hammering and drilling on a nightly basis.  Want a good night's sleep before an exam?  Better off crashing with a friend, or on the sidewalk for that matter.\n\n2.  The elevators.  The waits often take 10-15 minutes, and they randomly stop working at the worst possible times.  One Saturday night, the night of a football game, ALL FOUR elevators stopped working.  Have fun walking up to the 19th floor along with the rest of the residents.\n\n3.  Maintenance requests are constantly ignored.  On move in day, I requested to have the lock on my bathroom door fixed.  It is now November and nothing has been done.  Similarly, a month ago they decided to lock all of our windows so that we could barely open them.\n\nEveryone I know who lives here, absolutely hates it.  Just today I passed up a manager talking to two girls hoping to move in, and was highly tempted to alert them that this place is run by lazy, dishonest scammers.  I'm sort of wishing I did so."
1,"MMM...Strip Steak. Oh how I wish you were in Los Angeles.\n\nThis place would have received a 5 but the night started off rocky. \n\nFirst it was the bitchy hostess. Seriously honey, you aren't that pretty and that tat on your tit just makes you look cheap. I understand that it was a little bit late but you're a hostess, isn't it your job to at least be pleasant when greeting guests?\n\nEven though the service started out crappy, the food made up for it. First it was the free duck fries. I know what you're thinking. You're probably thinking ew.. duck fries. It's not really duck, just regular ol' french fries with a new name. The condiments it came with however, nothing close to regular. I remember it was 3 types of condiments, forgot the flavors but remember it being delicious. I think I ended up fighting with my date on who could have the last duck fry. \n\nThe steak..MMMM...mouth watering. *Insert picture of Homer Simpson drooling* I had a petite filet and loved it. My date on the other hand, had Kobe steak. I had a piece of his steak and had entree envy right away. His Kobe beef was exactly how Kobe beef should taste like, tender and full of flavor.\n\nYou would think after pigging out on fries and steak, that we would be done right? WRONG. We decide to order blueberry fritters for dessert. My God were they delicious. Even though I was dying from over eating I couldn't help wanting more. \n\nWe won't discuss the bill. I just know it was expensive. =X\n\nI would definitely recommend this place, just ignore the dumb hostess and you'll be fine."
1,"Came here with a date.  His choice, and glad he picked it. \n\nIt was a tad noisy for trying to get to know you without kinda yelling at your date across the table....Hope I didn't spit food on him. If I came with friends, the noise level would have been fine. \n\nI arrived early, so I sat at the bar and talked to the coolest bartender, Andrea.  She was the kind of person you just get drawn in and want to chit chat with all night.  She picked out a great glass of red wine for me too!\n\nWhen we say at our table, our waitress came around all bubbly and full of personality. I think her name was Kimberly. \n\nWe got the Caprese Salad to start and then tried the Diavolo pizza as our meal. Both were very delicious!!!  \n\nThe pizza was that good thin crust with lots of toppings and a great tasting crust. Definitely will be back here!"

This is a rare restaurant in that every single item on the menu is something I want to try.  We are going to make it a weekly visit for now on."
1,The prices are better than some of the other boba joints around and they offer some different stuff on their menu.  I sometimes opt for the smoothies w/ boba in them and they're fruity and refreshing....kinda like old Wham! songs.  You can also opt for less sugar in your drink which is nice too!

0,"You can sort of tell what Lulu is going to be like purely because of it's name, which really sums up the \""all fur coat and no knickers\"" situation that permeates across George Street. It's attached to Tigerlily, the only place in Edinburgh to have a slapper dolled up like a League Two footballer's wife on the door 24/7. That should tell you what to expect.\n\nAll the clubs here are pretty much the same, but I just find this one even more irritating than most it seems solely geared towards the more tiresome demographic of Edinburgh society. Describing itself as \""comfortabley exclusive\"" on the website is perhaps the final straw. George Street is not Park Lane, the two Wetherspoons and numerous \""To Let\"" signs adorning it should be all the evidence you need of that.\n\nCheesy, commercial music, mid-price drinks, Cliquey students during the week, and old boilers at the weekend. You've seen it all before.\n\nDespite the pretence that exists in the New Town, there are some great bars with plenty of character and atmosphere, surely there's room for at least one club to follow suit."

Burgers are made to order on the spot, hot & fresh..........not like some other joints where they are microwaved & put under the heat lamp. \n\n3. A very simple menu. They just do burgers, fries, shakes, & soda..........keepin' it simple, & they do it well!\n\n4. Restaurant is very clean, and the service is EXCELLENT!\n\n5. Open fountain kept very clean...........McDonald's could learn a thing or to (hint: McCully McDonalds!).\n\nLots of free parking..........but the place is always crowded on matter what time you go there.........Ka CHING!\n\nI also heard from a friend to order the Double Double \""Animal Style\""...........don't know what this is...........I'll have to try it one day."
0,"My husband liked this place, & it wasn't for me.\n\nThe restaurant was really tiny,  The service was fast & the food came out quickly, but the pork was really weird that came in the ramen. The noodles were good, & so was the fried rice. But the pork made me gag, and I normally like pork.\n\nNot what I was expecting. Neither of us would go back."
1,"I went back for the Wednesday night wine class and had the pleasure of enjoying the company of Donald S. and the Beautiful Carin for my visit. \n\nThis event is informative and fun for singles, couples or small groups. $15 per person gets you generous pours, a bottle of water (to cleanse your palate) and a meat and cheese tray for the table. \n\nEveryone tastes each wine at the same time and each wine is introduced by the distributor/representative who explains the terroir, process distinctions or  trivia about the wine maker.  A great opportunity to learn what you like and don't like about wine, but not pretentious. We were able to enjoy short conversations in between explanations. \n\nReservations are strongly suggested but can be made the day before the event, depending on the size of your group."
1,"When it comes to getting Mexican in C-U, this is probably my top pick.  It's cheap, the food I've gotten has been decent (the entrees are probably marginally better at Dos, except for the enchiladas, which are amazing!)  However, I keep coming back because of the chips, which are, in a word, incredible.\n\nI also really enjoy being here.  Very bright atmosphere, and very attentive waitstaff.  Keep the chips coming, and this place is gold."
1,"Frequent this place so much that they  should make a plate in honored of my name !\n\ntry the pasta shrimp. Its awesome. Hummus. Greek salad. Greek friends. The burger is amazing. The water is amazing too !( I joke about their plain, same, filtered.water... It is refreshing though)"
0,"This place is ridiculous! I went in to get a smoothie and there was no one there except me and the two friends of the employees there. They finally noticed me and asked me what I wanted, made it and the guy just put his hand out for money when he did not even tell me what the amount was. This happened on September 1, 2014 at about 230pm. Unprofessional and will not be going back to this place!!!! Horrible! I hope management sees this and does something."
0,"Been flying in and out of this airport for the past 6 yrs.  The only positive thing about this place is that it's right off the freeway.  With that said, they have the ABSOLUTE worst check-in process at the security gate.  There's no getting around it.  You'll be in line for a solid 45 min to an hour so plan accordingly."
0,"I was so disappointed at this buffet. I don't eat seafood, so I can't speak for that. Very little choices and subpar quality for the price."
0,"This place was gross! My water tasted like a toilet. We ordered a cheese crisp, which was over cooked . The fajitas for two was more like for three ( could have gotten the regular size). I was excited when I first saw them because I was so hungry!! Then, I took a bite and was disgusted! I don't know what spices they use, but it is not good. Who can ruin fajitas? Usually I can tolerate any quality of Mexican food. Just put a little salsa on it and it will be edible. I tried a second bite and wanted to choke! I couldn't eat it. Even my husband thought they were bad but he choked them down. We didn't tell the server because we didn't want to complain. I ate the chips and salsa which was ok. My husbands beer came in a margarita glass. We sat on the patio, we were the only ones there, and it seemed like every five minutes one of the workers was opening the door to look at \"" something\"" in the back. I don't know if they were worried about us leaving or if they were waiting on a drug run;) The server was nice but slow and forgetful.  Additionally, the food is waaaayyyyyy over priced. You are much better off going to Raul and Theresa's or even filibertos....lol."
1,"Someone just asked me what my favorite place to eat in Vegas is, and yep, Cornish Pasty Co. is the first place that popped into my head.  Who doesn't love some good old fashioned comfort food?? The BF and I have tried quite a few of the pasties now, and have loved them all.  My personal favorite has to be the bangers and mash though.  And we love the oven fries, OMG, they are so delicious!! And the deserts?? they are crazy good.  Everything is so fresh, and the service is always excellent.  And did I mention the prices?? So reasonable for Vegas.  Whenever we have out of town visitors, this is one of the first places we take them for lunch or dinner.  Definitely check this place out, you won't be disappointed."
1,"When my wife and I walked in, we looked around and viewed a site that made our eyes perk and our mouths water. Designed in a mode that is cool, eclectic, and visual--you are taken on a quick pace to your table.  Once seated, the menu challenge begins.  I say that because of its diversity and taking the time to decide what you really want to order.\n\nScanning the menu--we both made our own decisions on what to try.  My wife ordered the Heart and Seoul Burger.  It is laden with a variety of items (avocado, kimchi, onion strings, a farm fresh fried egg, and furikake-wasabi-mayo) with its ground Angus marinated in Sriracha and soy sauces.  I, always having a traditional burger desire, received their Standard Angus Burger which had lettuce, tomato, onion, and Louie sauce.  Both burgers had brioche buns with the name \""I Love Burgers\"" implanted in them.  \n\nHaving been to Vancouver, and enjoyed them, we asked for Poutine Fries.  These are a delight within their own.  Golden french fries covered with brown gravy, mushrooms, and carmelized onions could have been a meal unto itself (we asked them to leave the cheese off since I am lactose intolerant).\n\nFor dessert, we had a piece of lavish chocolate fudge cake that ended our meal on a high sumptuous peak!!\n\nSummary:  The burgers were truly a pure delight!!  My wife never once stopped eating hers and enjoyed every element of it.  Mine was one that could always be used to show how a traditional American hamburger should be cooked and created. I want to compliment their manager, Mark, for coming to check and see how things were going and our waitress, Ashley, who made sure everything was in place.\n\nAs a burger buff, I can say, if you love burgers, you will love \""I Love Burgers.\"" The food, quality, service, and environment makes this a stop you will always want to hang out at when heading to Vegas (unlike gambling--every dollar you spend here guarantees to make you a culinary winner!!)"
1,Great environments! Only downside is service is a bit slow !
1,My absolute favorite restaurant in the area.   Great menu that rotates on occasion.   The food is seriously great!
0,Hot links were very average. Terrible texture.
1,Lets just say this place is awesome! My sister in law ordered that huge ol' hot dog and shared it with 3 different people. I had a bbq chicken salad and it was pretty good and a very decent size. I wanted to take the cup home that they served our drinks it!  It is a fun place to work out and if your kids are scared of dark make up I would definitely steer clear of this place!!! But fun place to just enjoy a good lunch/drink or two!
1,"Pf changs is pretty good, there changs spicy chicken is a really good dish, the service is great! I go there almost every two weeks."
1,"We've only gotten take out from here.  Will have to dine in sometime to see if they rise to five.  The place is much larger than it appears from the outside.  Inside is decorated very nicely and it is exceptionally clean.  They have some nice benches available to sit while you wait for your take out and magazines are available.  It is cozy and a nice touch.  There is plenty of room inside  and I think we would really enjoy eating in some time.  They have a separate dinning area off to the side so they can seat quite a few people.\nThe menu is straight forward and easy to order from.\nOur food was delicious and we were very happy with it.\nThey really look like they are working at making this a successful restaurant and I for one would like to see a place like this stick around.   So try them out sometime.    They are sort of like a noodles and co but serve Thai and I would say they are better because of the depth of their menu and their atmosphere is a step up.   \nThey are in an odd location and I think this hurts them.  We will be back.\nWent back.  We feel the portion size is a bit small for the price.  So be prepared for this.  ie, no leftovers which is maybe a good thing."
1,Thit Heo Nuong is Amazing! Great Happy Hour!
0,"Was not able to use my gift card here.  Only explanation I got was \""Sorry, Starbuck's system is down\""\n\nAfter reading other reviews here, the problem with \""Starbuck's System\"" seems to be consistent at this location.\n\nOtherwise, it's okay if you like overpriced coffee."
1,You do not I repeat do not have to be a Beatles fan in order to love this show. It wasn't over the top and it ended in the perfect amount of time leaving you wanting more (just like they taught the bands back in the day). The acoustics were fantastic and keep your ticket so you can get a buy one get one free drink at the Beatles lounge that doesn't play Beatles music. The lounge was badddd. My personal tip get a seat in section 200 or above because the best stunt in the show you will not be able to see if your sitting close.
1,"Biaggis never disappoints. The food is always right on point, as is the service, and lots of yummy wines/martinis. The only issue is that Biaggis tends to be a smaller place with a huge following. On game nights, proms, graduations, and moms/dads weekends the restaurant becomes horribly packed and loud. The servers all do a great job to accommodate everyone. I'd recommend for the weekends such as graduation to make reservations months in advance. A nice perk is that Biaggis does rent out rooms. I love the outdoor seating in the summer too. I'm sad I only have 1 year left at U of I. Definitely will have to get my fill of Biaggis!"
0,"This place is was not that great. Dim sum is outranglusly expensive for what it is ranging from \""that's kinda expensive\"" to \""wtf? That's it for that price???!\"",and the cart was only offered once....I thought they are suppose continuously come with more options....\n\nBut at least you get an option to choose entrees from a menu, offering dishes from other Asian menus (Vietnamese, tiawaneese...) me and my boyfriend ordered the minced pork meat over rice (only because so many reviews said it was great), it just tasted \""bleh,\"" and makes me leave thinking \""I should have just gone to get McD\""\n\nThe best part of my meal was the ice latt\u00e9 my boyfriend got me next door"
1,"I thought this place was a great inexpensive place on the Las Vegas Strip.  More a place to stop in while shopping at the Fashion Show or if looking to watch some sports. \n\nDefinitely the bar seating is the best or the high tops nearer to the strip.  Great for people watching and taking in the view of the Wynn and Encore across the street.  \n\nThe prices are good and so are the burgers.  I had the Bleu Cheese Burger cook medium rare, which is what I got with no frills or fuss.  I also tried the spicy cheese fries which were pretty good, but could of been spicer.  \n\nOverall good.  The bar service a little slow, moreso because it seems as though the bartender had to fill table orders and neglect the people sitting at the bar.  This overloaded her.\n\nGo.\n\nDafe"
1,The italian panini is so delicious! Also it's decently priced! Yum yum yum they also have sanpellegrino in every flavor which makes me the happiest person.
1,"This is not your typical sports bar, but instead an upscale restaurant with sports memorabilia decorating every inch of every wall. The service was excellent. Strawberry Pena Colada is a must for hot days. Large portions- you get your monies worth. And if your a Giants fan- I hear they hang out here during Spring Training."
1,"I must admit I was a bit worried when I heard that Edinburgh was going to get an Urban Outfitters in 2009. If you know anything about Edinburgh, you'll know that there is a distinct style, that of the 'yah'. Hence why my heart sank a bit at the thought of Urban Outfitters - Edinburgh would get an entirely new species of yah - the cool one. But you know what? It's not so bad.\n\nUrban Outfitters has always been known for its edgy fashion and quirky bits n bobs. Rather than feel out of place in this ultra-cool shop, I felt quite at home! The layout is a bit difficult to navigate - the ground floor is ALWAYS busy yet the first floor, which is also womenswear, is never busy and all the dressing rooms are up here. \nHelpful hint - don't go here on a Saturday, there's just no point. The tills are also not in a great place, the queue clogs up the shop-floor and it's difficult to move around. But overall it's a great new arrival to the Princes St brigade."
0,"We went to a Christmas Eve Dinner with the family and I was let down hard! The Cioppino that I ordered for $50 was far from average. I've had a great cioppino and was not even worthy being called cioppino. The broth was like it was out of a can and the seafood was fishy (not fresh), more like frozen crap. Let's just say the entire dinner was a 1 star rating. The bill was over $500 and for what? I expected so much better. A big let down!!!"
0,"Very rude customer service. I had came to drop off and pick up a prescription for my son and noticed three boxes of diapers for 18.99 each. I go to pay and the rude man says it's 28.99. I go back to show him that there was more then one and it showed the price for 18.99. He replies \""that's for another brand and I'm not giving it to you for that price\"" Could he have been any more ruder. I mean I know it was close to midnight and he might have been moody and tired but this will be the last time I step into this Walgreens."
0,"One of Wolfgang Puck's Express sandwich and pizza chain spots, located in the LV airport. \n\nWe shared the chicken aioli sandwich ($10). Average ingredients; it's all about the sauce. It would have been much tastier if the bread bun was crispy and well-toasted properly, but then again it is a fast food service. Don't think Puck would have been satisfied."
1,I've been playing this course for years. Always been well kept and decently priced. Played here twice over the last month. Perfect as always. The only downside of this course is the stupid stone creek that runs through what seem like every hole. It is a black hole for golf ball especially if you are a big hitter. Leave the driver in the bag until the back nine.\n\nOver all I highly recommend.
0,"My sister said that Mr. Lucky's $7.77 \""Gambler's Special\"" was a MUST have while we were in Vegas and since we were staying at HRH it was convenient . We got to the hotel too early for check-in, so we decided to grab a bit to eat. I must say... there was nothing impressive about this meal - at all. It comes with a steak, 3 shrimp, mashed potatoes and broccoli. The steak was overcooked and very chewy, the shrimp was overcooked and the mashed potatoes and broccoli were extremely salty. It was horrible. It was my first meal in Vegas and I'm getting this?? Really! Yuck. \n\nWe went back on our last day to try breakfast since the rest of the menu didn't look too bad. I can't remember clearly what we ordered, but again it was very unimpressive. I do remember it was around $15 a plate for something I could make 5x better at home. I wouldn't recommend going here."
0,"Was expecting better. Ordered a 1/3 pound cheeseburger and fries. The wait time was average. When I got home to eat a few minutes later, I was pretty disappointed. The fries were hot, but had no salt on them. There was also no ketchup or salt packets in the bad, so the fries were not that good. The burger was equally bland. There was no seasoning on it and I can tell that the burger was not fresh. It was cold and seems like it was grilled hours before. \n\nFrozen burgers, frozen fries, no flavor. \n\nSad, I was expecting more."
0,"If I could give no stars I would. Service was terrible, waitress was not friendly, never came back to see if we needed anything, waited a long time to get the bill, she never came back, had to flag someone else to pay.  \nNow the food, it was very skimpy, piece of boneless chicken was barely 2 inches long and had no flavor, mashed potatoes must have come out of a box. This dinner came with a sundae that consisted of melted vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce. Had to flag down another waitress to get this as my waitress had disappeared. \nThe prices are very high for what you get, I have went here for the last time."
1,"This is one of those amazing places that could easily be overlooked.  For more than 14 years, the owners of Cafe Forte have tirelessly made a name for themselves by providing unadulterated cuisine or comfort foods for folks who like their meals freshly made with only quality ingredients.  \nBRAND NEW Comfort Hours from 3-5pm features awesome appetizers like their roasted Polenta cakes!  They also feature $4 glasses of select wines and beers, too!\nOne of their signature dishes is the Cafe Meatloaf with a light burgundy sauce and smashed potatoes.  They also feature many fresh seafood entrees as well as fine Italian specialties.\nBecause the restaurant is located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale,  on Main Street, just east of Goldwater Blvd,  you can enjoy the works of fine artists as well as the fine foods at Cafe Forte.\nI recommend  beginning your meal with the baked brie and sliced apples along with a nice Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand.\nCasual atmosphere with little votives and a fresh flower on each table is what you will see when you first enter the main dining room.  There is a bar area and when weather permits, an intimate garden for romantic dining.  They also do amazing pies and tortes for dessert.\nGreat for dinner on Thursday Artwalks or for a casual lunch with good friends!"
0,"We went to this place before when it was under different ownership and it wasn't too bad. But this time we were very disappointed. Service was slow. Our hamburgers were tasteless. Very disappointing.  On a more positive note I like how they've added more TVs and I do like the atmosphere, and our server was very friendly. They just need to get a new chef and a new menu."
1,"5-6pm is free sangria, all you can drink wine, along with appetizers.  Staff is super friendly, accomodating, and just darn wonderful.  Concierge helped us book tours.  Staff changed our room for us.  We forgot tons of stuff, and they were able to hook us up with a steamer for my blouse, hair straightener that I forgot.  Pool has a sandy beach.  Wifi free if you you're inTouch member and we got $10 free money for frig bar.  We dock one star for wiFI always being out in the morning, which was inconvenient.  Also the \""resort' is more of an overstatement as it's not a really a resort.  More a very nicely remodeled old hotel complex with 2 pools, 1 pretty lagoon, and 1 spa service area.  It's not a Scottsdale resort that you would imagine.  No bike trails, no golf course."
0,"My review is for the $10 all you can eat apps.  Terrible and nasty.  Over cooked and served cold.  Nasty.  I will not go back for that \""special\"".  The TV commercial makes it look so wonderful.  \n\nIt is too bad that I cannot rate our server, she was a 5++++.  Can't blame her for crappy food though."
0,"The bartender here is horrible, she only caters to the men.  I had to ask for a dinner menu yet I was the first in the place. She made sure the two men sitting on my side were taken care of.  Normally, I would give Morton's 5 stars but she ruined this location.    There was a problem with our crab cakes and the manager said he would take them off but she still charged us for them."
0,"When you go to Las Vegas, the things you must do are: Gamble, Drink, Eat, and enjoy the nightlife.  I have had the opportunity to go to Vegas many times and have gone to a few clubs.  One of the clubs I have been to is Pure, a nightclub in Caesar's Palace made famous by DJ AM (before he opened LAX in the Luxor) and the Pussycat Dolls Performances.  From my experience, I have gone to better places.\n\nFirst, your jaw will drop when you see the line to get in.  I remember the first time I went there my buddy and I just had it and just tipped the bouncer to get us in.  Once you get in, good luck moving.  I do not think the people who designed a nightclub realized that people like to dance at nightclubs.  They inserted too many hallways and not enough floor space for people to have fun.  \n\nNot going to complain about the prices at the bars since all clubs charge about the same for the alcohol.  I will give Pure an A+ for the hiring of their bartenders.  They were absolutely beautiful and outshined a lot of the girls at the club.\n\nAll in all you should try to go to the other clubs avaliable on the strip.  To me, the bouncers act like DMV employees giving the behind-the-wheel driving test; it's their faith to decide whether you pass or not.   Good Luck......."
1,"I've been craving Thai for a few days, which is strange since Vegas is like the Thai food capital of the U.S.  I've surprisingly found my latest ventures to be less than stellar here, having wanted to try something other than the usual Krung Siam/Thai, Lotus of Siam, and Archi's.  One thing I've concluded about Thai in Vegas is that, while still probably the best collection in the states, they are inconsistent.  I've had great meals at Krung Thai, and then came back for a decidedly mediocre meal the next.  Same experiences at Archi's, Kung Fu, and handful of others.  Lotus of Siam is consistently good, but consistently salty.\n\nSo my experiment continues, as I search for that go-to place.  Thai Style Noodle House was an utter failure, and Pam Real Thai was very mediocre.  I saw Arisra on Yelp with only a handful of reviews, but for the most part good.  It appears the resto really took the time to post a lot of pictures also (I suspect it was the restaurant, not the reviewers), both of which didn't give me a ton of comfort.  But what the heck, I was really in the mood for some crispy Thai fish which I hadn't had in forever, and this was a Thai seafood restaurant, so I took the chance.\n\nWe walked in at 4:30pm so as we expected it was empty.  The sign actually said they open at 5pm, but they were happy to have us in.  Very pleasant greetings, which continued throughout the meal.  The interior is not-quite modern and not-quite traditional, but not awkward either.  It felt cozy with modern-ish furniture mixed in with some typical Thai decor.  A stage sat at the corner, which I imagine is for a performer or karaoke typical to many Thai restaurants.  I should go there during night time sometime...\n\nI ordered a beer (Chang, no Singha) even though the Thai Mai Tai sounded good.  I'm thinking if the level 8 spicy we ordered on the spicy fried rice was burning hot, I can chug the beer.  Not so much the Mai Tai.  We also order the crispy fish of the day (Sea Bass, I think) and BBQ Squid.  Order takes some time - they are not fast - but what we receive looks very good with good presentation.  The squid is typical grilled squid, but comes with a sweet chili sauce on top and what looked and tasted like Thai chili salsa-like thing on the side.  Both sauce were great, although the salsa-thing was salty.  The fried rice was good and the fish was great.  Definitely satisfied the craving, and just what I was hoping for with super crispy skin and sweet chili sauce.  Neither were very salty as well.  3.5 stars for the squid and rice, 4.5 for the fish so it's a qualified 4-stars on food.\n\nCombine that with a cozy atmosphere, some live music (not while we were there), and pleasant service and we have a solid 4 stars.  I will definitely be coming here again because they have the most extensive seafood dishes I've seen at a Thai restaurant including about half-dozen fish dishes, and I want to try more of them.  It will also give me a chance to see if they meet my consistency test.\n\nTable-for-1 Factor:  It was perfectly fine while I was there, but I wonder if it will be different during busy time?  As it was, there should be no awkwardness eating alone."
0,"The box office is a bit disorganized, with the show starting at 530 and the box office barely opening at 5. This does not give people enough time to get their tickets and see the show.  Plus you get in late, you also don't get your drink order in."
0,I have had DIRECTV  before it was called that. I installed the receiver and dish myself where it would not be bothered by anything. So I upgraded to HD DIRECTV. They sent an installer out. He put the dish where trees would grow in front of it. Not where I had installed the dish clear of any blockage. So now I get to watch a TV service that goes in and out because of loss of signal. Simply because the DIRECTV  installer would not put the receiver where I wanted it.
1,Always good service and great food! I am a regular here and the staff are always so friendly.  I would definitely recommend this place.
0,"This was our first visit to this steak house, it's similar to Morton's and Capital Grill, but The decor was very dated & 70's-remember The \""York Steak House\""? not much ambiance, our waiter was fine, but the chef could not cook a steak medium if his life depended on it. to begin with, I had a horrible cut of fillet all gristle, first they served it practically raw, then they ruined it and sent it back charred but still rare inside. Then the Chef came out in a huff, he had butterflied the meat which had shrunk to nothing it was overcooked and inedible, I didn't complain further as I was with a client, BUT, They did nothing to correct it or replace it. I would never go back or recommend this place simply on their guest service. There are many other great steak house options available in Vegas..."
0,"Mediocre, unsatisfying and barely average!\n\nI joined a friend recently on a Friday night and the entire meal was barely passable. The calamari was uninspired and bland, just sauteed with a thin red sauce and a few frozen peas. Hardly inspiring. The 4 bruschetta were good, with interesting touches like honey and chicken liver, but another tasted like it had plain old strawberry jam on top of mascarpone cheese? \nThe fettucini carbonara was exceptionally bland and lacked the classic ingredients in abundance like it should including peas. Did they end up in the calamari by mistake ?  \n\nThe house recommended fresh tagliatelle with bolognese sauce was sad and uninspired and poorly prepared and presented. Really, as a Chef, I found the dish lacking any depth, including the unseasoned meat sauce (6 different meats in the sauce according to the owner, but still lacking any depth, flavor or significant interest). The sauce was mixed into the noodles already and looked very amateurish and very cafeteria-like. A real disappointment overall.   \n\nThe prices are actually a bit expensive for a strip mall and poor quality. Plastic cups for water, paper napkins for dinner service and piccolo pours of a limited wine selection only added to the lack of value. \n\nWill definitely not return. A disappointing experience that needs attention and correction."
0,"This place is very hit or miss. If you come when it's not crowded, you can get good food and good service. If the place is slightly busy, or you are very early or late, they are very unfriendly and act like they are doing you a favor to serve you food. I showed up late a couple times and wished they had just told me I was too late to eat. \n\nThe food is pretty bland and nothing that you couldn't make at home. A pancake with a snickers bar laid in the middle sounds awesome, but they do nothing else special with it. \n\nThe chicken is best but make sure you get it fresh and hot or else it's a bit soggy and sad. \n\nAlso, they tend to be very conservative to the point of mocking people on welfare.... So if morals guide you, let them guide you away from this place..."
1,"Their vision center is great, I went to a nationwide vision center and was very displeased by the care I got there, I went last night to Walmart vision center the staff is friendly helpful and talkative, there prices are actually affordable compared to some other optical centers I bought two pairs of glasses they were  $150 dollars cheaper then nationwide vision center price which is only seven minutes away from this Walmart vision center I will not be going anywhere else for my glasses now"
1,"We just moved out here this year.  We've been to 3 indian restaurants in Vegas so far, and this one is the best by far!  Soups are fantastic, the vindaloo, rogan josh and curry dishes are awesome, and the drinks are reasonably priced.\n\nBest indian restaurant in Vegas IMO."
1,"There is nothing better on a summer day then some fresh Mediterranean/ Greek Food. \nI was going to Trader Joe's and happened to see Amena in the corner of my eye so i quickly looked it up on yelp on my Iphone and say it got good reviews. \nWent inside and was happy how to see it is almost a deli set up with a little bit of table service.\nI had the Amena Salad $7.49 which had Mixed lettuce, Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Red onions, Feta Cheese, Walnuts and black olives with what i think was a herb vinaigrette. It hit the spot and was nicely balanced but kinda hard to eat with everything being small diced. \nSince i was hard torn between the salad and Falafel sandwich the cashier/ server/ busboy/ possible owner gave me three falafels and a pita bread for free.\nThe pita bread as Misti Y. sayes is AYUMYUMYUMYUM. taste like it was made minutes before it was brought out. and the falafel was very good. Crispy on the out side and soft on the inside with a great balance of herbs and spices. \nI would defiantly recommenced this place for a nice relaxed lunch.\nI will come back again."
1,"This restaurant is a \""must\"" for any lover of Latin A,Erica's cuisine.  I had the Frijoles con Seco a la Nortena (stewed beef with rice and beans) all I can say is \""wow\""! The beef was super tender and the dish had a great range of flavors and seasonings, very well prepared. It was enough to share if you also get an appetizer, as are some of the other dishes. Service was quick and pleasant, definitely a return visit on the agenda, although I'll make sure to share so that we can try the deserts too!"
1,"Tucked away in the gem that is Lake Las Vegas, you will find a small Marina where you can rent kayaks for $25.00/hour, and electric boats for $60.00/hour. You can also get paddle boats and boards. \n\nI recently held an event at the lake and Grant who works at the Marian couldn't have been more accommodating! \n\nI went on my first paddle board excursion and he gave me all the tips I needed to keep me from falling in the icy water. My guy and friends were convinced I was was going to fall in! Damn, have a little faith! \n\nWith reasonable prices, and a variety of water crafts, this is a must when you are looking for something different to do in Vegas."
0,"I've come here A LOT. Today I came for lunch and decided to place an order for take out. Usually we go and have NO ISSUES. This time we were practically ignored while waiting for our take out order, which you order from the bar. We ordered two salads which shouldn't have take 35 minutes to get, but it did. The duck dynasty looking dude at the bar who was getting COMPLETELY WASTED and smelled of alcohol when he walked past us was getting better service. PS it was 12:30 when we were there!!! About 5 people who ordered AFTER us were served their food before ours was ready. When we stood there looking at the bartender with the \""where the fuck is our order\"" glare she told us it was being \""boxed up now\"". 10 minutes later we got our food. I have been there about 6+  times, a few of those were with groups, and I can say I'll never go back. Thanks a lot."
1,"Came across this shop while at the deli next door for lunch. I had been looking to buy my first bike in a long time and been to some of the bike shops around town only to receive luke warm responses. \n\nNot PHX Bike. I walked in and saw a cool, small, local shop and knew I was in the right place. The owner Palmer was enthusiastic and pumped that I wanted to get a bike. He took his time explaining things that I should look for and didn't treat me like some like an outsider. So, I did some research on his recommendations and a few weeks later went back ready to buy the bike he reccomended. I was stoked, but I think Palmer was even more stoked. As I was walking out he said, \""You're going to have a new bike in a couple days!\""\n\nThis guy is knowledgeable, genuine and I look forward to being a long time customer."
0,"First, this should be 3 or 4 dollar signs.\n\nGreat food, but not for the money.  There should be more seafood in the seafood dishes.  We went with a group of seven.  The waiter kept giving us things that we didn't order - 2 dishes and a drink.  He left the things at the table and said I won't charge you for this, at which point we shared them or asked to have them packed up.  At the end, all of these mistakes showed up on the bill, inflating it by around $30.  He refunded one of the three items.  If they want to charge prices like they do, the service and customer satisfaction should be better.  \n\nThere were also a lot of other little mistakes.\n\nA better server could have made this 4 stars.  Also, if I didn't dissuade you from going, try the Bagnettes (awesome powdered doughnuts.)  A very nice desert to share with 2 or 4."
1,Best risotto I've ever eaten.
1,We went here a couple of times for a late afternoon glass of wine and snack.  We sat outside on one occasion and sat at the bar on another occasion.  Service was pleasant and efficient.  We found the ambiance and experience to be relaxing and a nice way to pass some time and have a light bite.  There were lots of interesting wine selections by the glass.  We would visit again.

0,"Ordered a large Mango-Pineapple smoothie. Stayed in line 5 minutes from the time I ordered. Which was okay, I made sure I started out 10 minutes early for the trip. $3.64 for a large. Got to the window stayed an additional 3 minutes. No big deal. Until...... Ma'am We no have Mango. We have Um.. Strawberry. Reluctantly I said Ok... It's just Strawberry right? Not Strawberry-Banana? Si Strawberry- Banana. Side note...( I don't like Strawberry- Banana) No ma'am I would just like my money back... refund please... she gave me $3.53 back? Wasted my time and made a profit! Geez!!"
0,"I went there for lunch with my boyfriend. We are both cajun food fans. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip with crab. I ordered jambalaya, and he ordered the combination plate. They were all edible but not very pleasing to the palate. The  staff was nice, but the main entries took almost an hour to come out. It was pretty disappointing. I don't think I would come back."
0,"New to vaping. From out of town. Wanted to see what was up with the Vegas vaping scene. Not much from the looks and attitudes in this store. As I walk through the door I was there 10 minutes with out any type of greeting. NONE. They have 3 seats at the tasting \""bar\"" all 100 flavors are behind a counter, after the 5th flavor request guy with glasses was so annoyed and inconvenienced and gave an eye roll showing how displeased he was. I bought a few sample flavor bottles and took off. Disappointed. The owner was very nice. Does he not see how rude rude rude his counter guys are?  Don't bother to ask a question. You will most probably get an eye roll. \nThey do mix flavors fresh for you which I thought was very cool. The lady mixing obviously didn't want to be there either. I feel bad, but with this extremely poor customer service I can't imagine they will be able to keep the doors open long."
1,"I really, really like The Caves. I wish it was actually a full time night club or bar, because I'd be keen to attend this underground party and events venue quite regularly. \n\nI've been to The Caves on several occasions for private parties, and the atmosphere of the venue brilliantly suits general merriment and fiesta indulgence. The low lighting, arched cave ceilings and character laden interior make The Caves a fantastic place to dance, drink, and do dark deeds in dark corners (nothing too bad, maybe just a cheeky smooch). Anyway, the point is that hanging out in The Caves makes you feel very cool and underground, because, well...you are underground, but also because partying in a sultry lit cave with no view of the outside world makes you feel like you're part of something no one know about for a few hours. Parts of The Caves feel like you've gone back in time a few hundred years, or you're on a film set where something spooky is about to occur. One off club nights are held here now and again, so get in on one if you fancy having a peek at this venue, or else crash someone's wedding if you fancy a more challenging manner of gaining entry."
1,"Have really enjoyed seeing concerts at this venue.  They are now getting the word out that they are open starting at 11am for lunch, delicious guacamole and interesting burritos with locally sourced ingredients.  A nice place to relax over a quick lunch with friends.  They said there are happy hour specials so check back for those."
1,"DREAM DINNER!!!! Apps:Hot rocks, calamari, onion soup, entree: bone in filet with a ritz cracker crab stuffed lobster tail sides: Mac n cheese, creamed spinach and smoked wild mushrooms. I eat here more times then I can remember and every single time I am amazed on how delicious the food is, and how amazing the the staff and managers are. Monte Carlo sometimes has a rep for a certain crowd that doesn't appreciate good food, that's why I listen and read reviews by people who actually eat!! And I do eat .. A lot!!!! I've tried many steak houses and by far BRAND is the best!!! Trust me you will not be disappointed!"

0,"My friend and I used the recent $25 for $50 Groupon to check out Pewter Rose on a Saturday night. \n\nHonestly, I thought it was a little bit on the pricey side for what it was so I'm glad that we had the coupon. The atmosphere was pleasant but a little kitschy and I kind of felt that plastic tablecloths were inappropriate when you're charging $20+ a plate. \n\nThat said, it was absolutely packed in there. We had reservations for 8pm and arrived right on time and the hostess was able to find us a seat within about 5 minutes. However the first thing out waiter said was essentially \""We're really busy tonight so I hope you're prepared to wait a while for your food\"". We weren't in any rush and agreed that was fine. The service was good, our waiter was very attentive and kept our water glasses filled but even though we ordered as soon as we were able to, it was after 8:30 before we got our appetizer and 9:20, and honestly that was more waiting than I had expected to do. While the restaurant was full, it is not *that* large. \n\nI had the seafood risotto and it was pretty delicious and I would eat it again. My friend had the herb encrusted lamb and while it was good, we both found it to be overly salty. \n\nI might come back and try the brunch but I don't think I'd pay full price for the dinner."
0,"Another Fox restaurant...yawn. \n  We started out on a bad note when we took a seat at the bar to wait for our table. The bar was really cool looking and we loved the idea of using green apples as paperweights. The selection of wine and beer was really decent for a place with a limited menu. The bartender, however, poured us pathetically small glasses of wine. It would have been ok if it appeared to be consistent, but we saw several glasses going out to tables that were much fuller. They weren't exorbitantly priced glasses, but I still want what I'm paying for!\n  Next, the food. The zucchini fries were bland and fell apart, but the sauce that they came with was pretty tasty. The truffle fries were lacking in a good truffle flavor. Some of the fries in the basket were soggy and some were burnt. We sent most of them back. The veggie burger was super good. Just about one of the best veggie burgers I've ever tasted, surprisingly. The report from the ahi burger was \""ok\"". The report from the Zinburger was \""ok and undercooked according to my order\"". The sweet potato fries were delicious. \n  The service was good. Elizabeth busted her butt to get us everything we needed, despite the clear lack of organization in the rest of the restaurant: The place had cleared out considerably by the time we ordered, and it still took about 30 minutes to get our food!\n  As with most Fox Concepts, it's all concept and no substance. From most of the other reviews, I don't expect a long wait for tables in this place the very near future."
1,"Damn It I got beat! Arrrghh yea so this was the Original of the copied Pinkberry. When one of my employees told me about it next to Joe's Pizza....I freaked because now I don't have to go to LA for this fantastic Korean staple of yummy dessert goodness. She also said they were a little bourgeois(prounounced bouzje wa) OK so they boast that they use real Yogurt and Pinkberry uses powder. Hmmm....Whatever it's good. The decor is like stepping into gramma's house but it got hit by a ball Harajuku Girls. It's got the whole minimalist yet plastic furnature outside. Modern, chic, and some over the top. Employees were newbies. So don't expect too much right away. Two flavors...GREEN TEA, and Regular....not really vanilla because of the hint of tarts. You have crazy toppings like Captain Crunch, fruity pebbles, cocoa pebbles, granola, mango, blueberry, banana, strawberry, etc...I guess the owner or manager overheard me because I'm loud. But I was looking for mochi too. He said that they would be getting them made soon! I also found out they're open till 3am? or was it 4am? Whatever....it's open late. That means late night cravings...GONE! WOO HOO!"
0,"Meh. I've experienced better.\n\nPaid full price to take myself and the two kids, which on reflection would have been better spent staying at the pinball museum.\n\nIt was nice to be allowed to touch the figures which made getting photo's better but the the lighting is so bad it's almost impossible to get a good pic. I noticed quite a number of the figurines were missing, maybe the ok to touch policy has a draw back ?\n\nIn summary the two kids ages 8 and 10 loved it, they even liked the 4d marvel movie which I was just sadly disappointed in the animation. I thought it was overpriced and a waste of time."
0,"Omg they give out toppings like they are going out of business and trying to make their last bits of food last.  I feel like I'm being rationed.  What the heck, how much can beans and rice really cost!?"
0,"Went to Flancers the first time this last week.  I got the Prickly Pear Caesar Chicken.  I was not a fan.  The dressing didn't taste much like Caesar and while the Prickly Pear flavoring was tasty, it seemed odd for a Caesar.  I got the salad when we could not get a wheat crust pizza larger than 10 inch for the hubbie and I to share.  He said the pizza was okay, but it didn't look appetizing to me.  The bread that came w/ my salad, loaded w/ parmesan cheese, was tasty, but for a carb watcher, too much.  Now that I think about it, I don't remember the taste of parmesan on the salad.\n\nMy biggest knock on the place:  the lager beer selection.  American lagers only.  I don't care for American lagers.  Bud Light makes me burp, a lot, and American lagers to me lack the flavor of a Stella, Phuket, Corona, Peroni, etc.  For a restaurant that offers beer pairings, they need to overhaul the lager selection for those of us not into ales.  I'd visit one more time if I could have a Stella w/ my meal, but with the lager selection, I can scratch them off my list."
0,"Funny how a Fellow New Yorker appraises this spot as a 2 star restaurant, and most of Charlotte raves about it. Food is fresh, but bland and dull. I say save your money and go elsewhere."
0,"The check in line was crazy long. They had everyone working up at the desk, but the wait was ridiculous. If they would not waste time trying to sell upgrades to every guest checking in, the process would be much faster.  Not the newest rooms, but you are also not paying Venetian prices."
0,"The quality has dropped from our last 2 visits, shrimp were old and mushy. What a shame I really enjoyed this place."
0,"staff was very typical of chinese restaurants, cold and sterile with evident love for their job. all the dim sum tasted the same because most of their dishes were made from shrimp. service was adequate, but the food was embarassing for my guests."
1,"AMAZING food, drinks, and service!!!! It is nice to splurge once in a while, and I recommend this place for Romantic dinners, or maybe even a business dinner!!! The Lobster and steak is to die for. Extremely classy place. Very expensive, but was worth it! The Champagne was flowing, and we were front row to the GREAT live band!!! This is a MUST TRY place in Scottsdale!!!!"
1,Easy to navigate. Plenty of food options. Careful about the distance between terminals though..
0,"They should change the name to Streets of Bejing because their pizza, wings, and sandwiches are about as far from New York as anything I've ever experienced!\n\nEven the worst New York pizza is better than what this place is serving up.\nThe wings tasted like they were dipped in vinegar.  No flavor.\nI've eaten at this location several times, each time thinking how maybe I just got a bad dish, or they were off their game that day. Not the case. \n\nGood thing for the owners how most people in Arizona who enjoy S.O.N.Y. have never tasted real New York Pizza and wings, otherwise they'd have been out of business long ago.\nI will never grace their doorstep again, even if they were giving it away!"
0,Was recommended by a friend...would never come back!  Our room smelled like a cheap deodorizer...gag me!\nNot handicap friendly!  Walked a long ways with luggage..thru smoke filled lobby to get to 17th floor.

0,"The drawing card for the Circus Circus Buffet used to be  $4.99 breakfast, $5.99 lunch and  a $6.99 or $7.99 dinner.\nI took a group to Las Vegas and thought it would be a good CHEAP place for lunch.\nI was amazed to find out the lunch was now  $10.99 ......\n\nThere is no way this buffet is worth that......\nI know you are saying that it is 1/3 the cost of other casino/hotel buffets.\nYes it is , but the quality is nowhere near one third of the other hotels.\n\nA major disappointment ...... \nvery, very average buffet fare at best.\n\nWe were lucky that there was no line ....\n( perhaps that should have been our clue )\n\nShould they get two stars because they are inexpensive .....\nI think not."
1,"One of the best Indian restaurants in town. \n\nThe dosas are great, the tandoori chicken is fabulous, the butter chicken is awesome and the naan is delicious. Enough said!\n\nAnd they deliver; which none of the other indian restaurants do."
1,"Supreme quality, but extreme pricing. A great place for lunch, happy hour, or to make a good impression. \n\nLove the ambiance, ideal for a date, business meeting, or any sort of good impression, and the staff is top notch too.\n\nThe sushi, especially sashimi, is high grade. Amazingly fresh stuff, and the selection is varied with different types. For a truly special occasion try the lobster dynamite-- it might have been one of the best seafood dishes I have ever tasted. \n\nThe cocktail menu is impressive, but the martinis can be a bit strong. \n\nDinner pricing is high, but nothing unusual for the marketplace, and portions are small, but like I said before you're paying for the quality and atmosphere."
1,"Absolutely the best burger in Las Vegas... or quite possibly in the US?\n\nMost of my experience comes from the San Francisco Bay Area, and I've tried dozens of places, if not hundreds, from cheap burger joints to upscale restaurants. Like Umami Burger, Roam Artisan Burgers, 4505 Meats, Mission Beach Cafe, SuperDuper, Chow, Marlowe, or even Spruce... Some of them were fantastic, but Bachi goes even further. My wife agrees.\n\nI don't know what makes us addicted to their burgers, but I'm pretty sure they put some kind of cocaine in the ingredients. We need to blow a whistle to invite DEA to stop this madness. But before doing that, please allow me to have one last bite of the Miyagi-san burger... or the Kiki burger... or the Ronin burger... or the Just Fries... oh please help me!"
0,"Took 14 guests for lunch at Red Lobster on 1/4/2014.  Portions were small, service was slow and not very good, shrimp were watery and had a frozen fishy taste, lobster was unedible, some orders were not correct and one guest was charged an extra 2.49 for each tea glass refill.  Some tickets were double charged and some of the meals were extremely overcooked and even burnt.  Will never go to this Red Lobster or ANY Red Lobster again.  Also learned several of our group got sick overnight from this food, one of the group was even in the ER on 1/5/2014!!!  Altogether a horrible luncheon which none of the group enjoyed - worst service of any restaurant this group has ever been to.  Food does not come out looking anything like the pictures on the menu :("
0,"Thoroughly disappointed in their business practice. The sign said $79, I said I'll buy it, a guy comes up and says we have the footboard in the back. Next lady changed the price to $299. They raised the price nearly 40% right in front of me after I already said I would buy it for the listed\nPrice. Shady business!"
1,"Good rolls. Nice atmosphere, Sunday football. Great specials, the eel roll and spicy tuna are good but Red Hot Chili Pepper roll is the best there is! Pork egg roll is delish, so is there spicy edamame and Miso is great too. Staff is ok, seating and drinks are pretty good too. Very cool decor. Oh yeah great ginger and blue wasabi :)."
1,"Walking past it, you would think this was a divey place with terrible food.  My friends brought me here and the soup was awesome.  I forget the name of it, I think it was Tom Kar Gai.  Mmmm, I could go for some right now."
1,"We bypassed the wait by grabbing seats at the bar.  Great beer selection, we went with a pitcher of fat tire which was new to us East Coasters.  Delicious burgers, huge and juicy.  We also had the deep fried pickles which were surprisingly tasty.  Overall it was a great place to sit, grab a burger and relax."
0,"I had high hopes for this place when I heard that it was opening. Asian food in the heart of Vegas's newest attraction, the Linq. That sounds like good news to me and good is what I was expecting. Unfortunately, my hopes were shot down soon after watching my friend order food. \n\nThey have a boba place inside as well as a place where you can order dishes like a restaurant and a place where you can order food down a line like Panda Express. Looking at the prices that they had at the boba place, it was a little pricy and I can't expect it to have that much better quality than somewhere off the strip, and so I deem the price a little higher than normal. I understand rent must be expensive, but they won't be making money with higher prices. \n\nThe area where you can order food had a variety of dishes from different Asian cuisines, but this again was a little expensive. I can't imagine it tasting any better than somewhere off the strip at a specific ethnic restaurant, and especially for the price they were charging, $11 for fried rice is a little much. They also have dim sum & dumplings and they list it out what kind they have on the window. The prices are a little expensive for how much they give you, which is the usual 4 at traditional dim sum places. $4.99+ for an order is not worth getting while you are there, you might as well go out somewhere else off the strip for dim sum. \n\nThe area where you can pick out food like at Panda Express was also pricy and it didn't look very good, it seemed as though it was sitting out there for a while. When my friend ordered food from there, she got the duck and they microwaved it... You know, when you're at home at they're leftovers, it's ok to microwave food, but when you order food from outside of your own home, that ain't cool bro. That right there was just shocking for me that a place would even do that. So I don't think the food will look too appetizing unless it came fresh out of the kitchen, just make sure they don't microwave the food before they give it to you.\n\nLast but not least, when my friend's food was finished, they brought the food out to where we were sitting. When the waitress (or whatever category you want to put them in) brought out her food, the tray didn't have utensils and the waitress said she forgot and asked her to get it herself. Umm... I think that's a little bit rude to say, and you have a job where you mostly stand right next to the front anyways, so I don't understand why she couldn't have just gotten them right after. \n\nI don't mind the higher prices of the places inside the Linq, I can at least understand that much, but when you have unappealing food, microwave food, and have bad service, that's a big nono there. Eat before you go to the Linq if you can."
1,"I can say nothing but great things about this man! I gave him 3 pairs of heels and a belt today, and it was done it 40 minutes! And the price was so reasonable!  He is super sweet and will give you honest feedback about what you really need done! For example, I got an estimate from another cobbler regarding boots I needed fix about 6 months ago.  He wanted to replace both zippers because one was broke.  It was gonna cost me more than the shoes themselves! This man, however, just said the zipper needed to be fixed and nothing had to be replaced! He charged me 1/4 of the price of what the other guy tried to get out of me.  I love shoe shop!  Oh, and like the post above, it is not in scottsdale - it's actually in Phoenix (PV Mall)."
0,I really don't like giving bad reviews and I've had my fair share of delicious and really bad tasting pho. Today I came here with my family and ordered a pho chin (brisket) and my mom got the seafood pho... my goodness I might as well have gotten noodles in a bowl of plain water. The broth was disappointingly bland even with sriracha and hoysen sauce... we seriously had to reach for the salt. The noodles were kinds hard... Maybe it was an off day for them but I probably won't be back
0,"Too expensive, kind of plan, not enough portion for the price and not authentic asian food! \n\nThe only thing I like about PF Chang is their drink menus. Otherwise service kind of sucks and so does the food. They are super busy also; so be prepare to wait to eat overly price food. \n\nI heard the PF Chang is a lot better in the South Park area, but having the experience I did at this PF Chang I don't think I want to waste my time again."
0,"Dirty restaurants....broken bathrooms...most of the food is just ok. Just go to a Denny's if this is what you want and pay less. Otherwise Arizona has plenty of other much better breakfast restaurants to choose from. I guess when you have absentee owners or ones that cheap out...this is what you get. Go to the US Egg, Daily Dose, or Breakfast Club in Scottsdale instead."
1,"Went to the Belk Bowl here. I couldn't believe how nice the stadium is inside. When Atlanta builds a new stadium, they need to take note. I was impressed by the food selection & quality. The bathrooms stayed clean & the attendants were all very nice & smiling. Kudos to the designers & managers of this facility. We had a nice visit to Charlotte & a W in the BoA Stadium."
1,"Beautiful place, uber trendy, great drinks and amazing food located inside the Venetian hotel. We were here with a group of 13 for a birthday party. The service was great, although we had reservations we still had to wait about 45 minutes to be seated. I think everyone loved their food. It is a bit pricey but its such a great spot. I got a couple of tempura dishes (sweet potatoe and avocado) and some type of chicken dish. My husband tried sushi and something else and we are both a fan. It turns into a club upstairs at night and it's free to get in as long as you get your hand stamped. However, you still have to go back outside and wait in line again to go into the club. The club was too crowded, loud, and had a much younger crowd that what I would have liked so we didn't enjoy the club portion but the restaurant is a must do!"
0,"The service was great especially for it being so packed. I was told they had the best happy hour, but was less than impressed. I also got the poutine, which was okay...not the best but not terrible. I didn't stay for long, but it seemed like a fun place to go with a bunch of people for expensive drinks."
1,Stayed again 10/17/2014\nExcellent check in by Bruce and our queen room was clean! I love this place! \nParking was a little rough later in the evening  and several work trucks made navigating the parking area difficult.  I would suggest to the management to have the larger vehicles park on the street. Checking out was quick and easy!
1,Just had another great meal from Zaw's.  I have tried something different every time I've gone there and they do not disappoint.    \n\nI love Zaw's and will go back soon.
1,"The closest touristy, Arizona-esque candy shop to me here in Central Phoenix.\n\nCactus Candy Co is located in a small building room, stocked with: hot sauces, jellies, marmalades, cactus gummies, prickly pear taffy and shirts. Upon entering I was greeted and was given some advice on the popular items people typically purchase. It was helpful, good amount of candies and jellies but definitely limited. Two thumbs up for having a discount with paying with cash + being a student. With the discount it ended up not being too expensive either. \n\nI got a few boxes of prickly pear candies, taffy and jelly for my friends and family back home. Crossing my fingers they'll enjoy the distinct taste of prickly pear from the good ol' Valley of the Sun!"
0,"I decided to try this place because they have a yelp coupon ($35 for $50) and it was open today on Easter.  When I walked in they told me that the coupon isn't valid on weekends (which wasn't specified on the coupon or website) but they decided to honor it regardless (+1 star). I was thankful that they honored the coupon but I was dissatisfied with the gel manicure. The man who did my gel pedicure was excellent (+1 star). My gel manicure was a disaster, first the lady had to re-do my right thumb 3 times because the gel Polish kept bubbling and sliding. Probably because she kept me seated at the pedicure station instead of moving me a to a table. And instead of fixing two other fingers on my left hand (they have a weird ridge going along the nail bed) she just left them (probably out of frustration). I didn't complain because at that point I have been there for a while and could tell she was just over fixing my manicure. My advice would be to skip this place for a gel manicure and get the guy to do your pedicure."
1,Wow. Their sandwiches are awesome.Their pizza is amazing too. $4.99 for 2 mega huge slices of cheese pizza and a drink. The slices were so big they packed it in a medium pizza box haha. I was SO full from the first slice.  It was just perfect everything.
1,The shrimp and grits were great...great atmosphere
0,"$24 for a burger and beer.  \n\nAn airport is not the sort of place where one searches out fine dining.  In fact, it the sort of place where hungry travelers seek out average dining at stratospheric prices.  Such is the case at Burke in the Box at McCarran Int'l Airport in Las Vegas.\n\nThe good:\n\n1)  The only place I could find on concourse D near my gate (53) which accommodated sit-down dining.\n2)  Wide selection of hot dogs, burgers and sandwiches.  I ordered a cheese burger with blue cheese, raw onions, lettuce and tomato.   The burger came with a generous helping of (what appeared to be) re-heated French fries with truffle oil.  I also had a 20oz Stella.\n3)  Good selection of adult beverages\n4)  Modest selection of dessert\n\nThe bad.\n1)  OH MY GAWD: The bill.  $24 for a burger and a beer!!\n2)  Understaffed.  The gentleman in the table next to me got up leaving his sandwich on the table to go the bar and order another drink.  While he was away the waitress cleared away his half-eaten sandwich.\n3)  Pretense at fine dining.  The place is self serving trying to portray itself as haute burger-land: something which it is not.\n4)  Televisions hanging on the wall with the volume up very high. \n5)  The waitress added bacon to my burger - which I didn't ask for and charged me $1.99 extra.\n\nOverall:  I wish more airports were like Dulles Airport in Washington where the prices in there are pretty close to those you'd pay outside of the airport.  The food was decent but it was not fine dining: no way.\n\nWere the burger, fries and beer had come in at $15 I'd be singing the praises of this high-rent burger joint.  At $24 - not so much.\n\nIn Vegas one has the opportunity to gamble at almost every turn.  Rest assured that if you venture into this establishment that you'll come up with snake eyes."
1,"This is a true wellness healing center! Nestled in a perfect location, with several surrounding eatery's it's a gem!  I went in with a level 8 pain in shoulder, hips and lower back from old motor vehicle accidents, etc.  I've tried EVERYTHING including 2 chiropractic procedures under anesthesia and still have pain.  In one session with Jesse my pain dropped to a 2 and gets better by the day.  Jesse brings so much love, knowledge and intuitive talent it's almost indescribable!   With all his powerful modalities, cupping, aromatherapy, body work, energy etc. you get exactly what you need.  \n\nJesse knows what your body needs even if you don't.  He is bringing health to individuals and the community with his center.  Workshops, smoothies, community, healing... it's ALL here!  I'd chill, work or hang out in his lounge any day over Starbucks!  His team is just as loving, caring and energetic.\n\nI've known Jesse for years and never came to him for services!  Now I'll never go anywhere else for massages and healing work.  Don't wait... your health is too precious!"
1,"Lobster Me, please!\n\nI go here every time I'm in Vegas, which is once or twice a year. I can never decide between  the lobster grilled cheese (yum) and my fave - lobster mac&cheese (deeeeelish!), but the mac&cheese always prevails. I've had a sampling of their lobster ice cream and lobster bisque, which I wasn't feeling. Next time, I'd like to try their lobster roll (but for $22 - yikes!). Definitely a great place for lobstah lovers."
0,"This place is a disgrace.  You can see that this is a horrible place as soon as you enter the hotel.  All the employees there are trained to generate revenue I guess.  \n\nOn my first day I asked one Nigerian employee about the Buffet and he showd my how to get to the Buffet place.  I went there only to find out that the Buffet was closed for renovations.  This dude was only interested in selling the show tickets and he did not care how he treated the \""Guests\"".\n\nThe room had no coffee machine and no wifi.  The bed was good though.\n\nPlease stay away from this place!!"
1,"Have been eating lunch here on Wednesdays for years.  (Wednesday being half price wine day).  Excellent salads, especially the Tavern House salad.  The burgers are out of this world.  Try the bacon cheddar burger and you won't be disappointed.  No overcooked, dried out burgers here.  I order mine medium rare and it's always cooked to perfection."
1,"I've never had a good pizza delivery experience in Vegas. Boston Pizza changed that. It's Friday night and I stayed in with a friend and a lot of wine. A lot of wine later, and this place is the only one willing to deliver. Also, holy mother of Thor, are they GOOD. Not even just \""I'm drunk and hungry\"" level good; I mean, legit good."
0,"This place is circling the drain.  I don't get it... The location is great with little competition nearby but when we went there today they were so slow and the food was so poorly cooked that we won't be going back and will drive 10 minutes more to go somewhere else.  The place has a lot of potential, good menu and ambiance, but the execution is poor.  I hope they go out of business soon so someone can open up something better at that location."
0,"Ok, here's the thing.. I like Icehouse ok.  I've met my husband there for lunch several times.  I've just not been wowed by the two big things I look for in a dining establishment.  Food and service.\n\nThe food is ok.  I can't say I've had anything that's really bad, but nothing really memorable, either.  Once, the buttermilk fried chicken was super good, but on a repeat visit, it was tough and the gravy was watery.\n\nAs for service, I've not been impressed at all.  I've only ever seen female waitstaff, but they never smile, or try to convey that they're remotely interested that anyone is there.  It makes for a rather boring experience, in my opinion.  I'm not saying they need to sit down and ask for my life story, but at least smile.\n\nI'm not saying I won't go back, I probably will, but this place is way down on my list of places I would enjoy frequenting."
0,"I took my Bassett hound in on Wednesday 11/7/12 she has something wrong with her left eye looked greyish. They did no testing and gave her drops for possibly being bitten, by Saturday morning the eye was almost completely grey and I took her back the doctor came in didn't even look into her eyes and said it has to be Valley Fever and needed to do blood work but started treatment on Saturday and would call when the results came in. She acted like I was wasting her time by asking questions about Valley Fever. I just moved to Arizona and had never heard of it. So we did blood work and more medicine and off we go. By Tuesday afternoon I get the call saying quit giving her the pills for Valley Fever and take her to the Eye dr for animals it must be glaucoma and they can't help. So, after $300.00 with them and another $300.00 for the eye dr YES she does have glaucoma and is blind in the eye  I believe they possibly could have saved her sight if she had been diagnosis properly"
1,"I used to work here in the Forum Shops and was one of those anticipating for Carmine's to open and finally got to try them out last week. I came here with a party of 11 to celebrate my aunt's birthday. I must say my aunt and her family are from NY and have eaten at the Carmine's there, so the expectations were set pretty high. I do love the inside of the place especially how the high raised ceilings have all sorts of pictures hanging on the walls. If only the restaurant was in a stand alone building then it would truly give that Manhattan feel. Before anything was served we noticed that the plates were at the end of the table, my aunt expected the server to place each plate in front of us because that's what the server did in NY. It didn't happen, so I guess here it's more of a self serve concept. My beverage of choice was the strawberry lemonade since another review mentioned how good and tart it was. She was right I did enjoy the tartness(tasted similar to Red Robbin's Freckled Lemonade), too bad it's not free refill because I sure did finish that drink before the food was served.\n\nSo here is the break down of the food:\n\nCarmine's salad- I liked all the additional toppings in this salad like berries, nuts, and salami if I remember correctly. We had 2 salads and assumed they were the same because they looked very similar. After tasting both we realized the other one was a mixed green salad. I prefer Carmine's salad and say it's worth the $3 difference. \n\nCalamari- pretty standard, wasn't too greasy and the breading was like how I've had it at other Italian restaurants.   \n\nZuppa Di Clams (white)- I am not a fan of clams but my brother convinced me to try the last piece and I was pleasantly surprised. If you enjoy clams I definitely would recommend this dish, pretty delicious I must say. The sauce for the clams was so good we saved it to put on our pasta.\n\nBroiled porterhouse steak- this was really delicious and I thought it was perfectly cooked with various pieces being rare and medium (refer to the picture). One of the better cuts of steak I've had from a restaurant. Warning this is pricey, costing $80.\n\nChicken Scarpariello- I read from another review recommending this dish and when we ordered it the server said they were out?! I was shocked at first because I've never heard of a chicken dish running out at a restaurant. Thankfully she came back and said they still had it. It was cooked in a buttery sauce, probably my favorite dish of the night and reasonably price. I will definitely order this the next time I come back. \n\nThere was a pasta dish we ordered but I can't remember what the name was. Next time I come, I'll also order the Rigatoni & Broccoli as recommended by another yelper. According to my aunt and her husband the food was a little on the salty side, but still a good quality in comparison to the one in NY. However the service was lacking. I really want to come back but it probably won't be any time soon. This place was pricey so I'll have to find a special occasion to come here for."
0,"Stay away!  This place is awful.  We came home from a camping trip to the A/C being out and not being able to stay in our home, so we came here for a night.  The room smelled stale and gross, and was poorly lit.  We could not control the temperature in the room and I doubt it cooled off below 85 degrees in there (not much of an improvement to the house!).  There were 2 queen beds and we requested a roll-away since we were there with our three children.  Knowing that we had 5 people in our party, we were still only provided with 3 towels and 2 washcloths in the room.  The d\u00e9cor, the furniture and the paint are all in SEVERE need of an update.\nMy husband and I thought we'd go down to the pool to help cool off.  WRONG!  the pool area was filthy dirty.  There were dirty pool towels laying about, but no clean pool towels available for us to use.  The pool had some sort of film over it and the water was filled with all sorts of \""floaties.\""  The bottom of the pool was also filthy.  We tried to stick our feet in the hot tub instead, but that was also equally filthy.  The grounds were poorly kept, the trees and shrubs appear to be dying and no one has swept any of the walkways for what appears to be months.  This morning, the \""free\"" breakfast was burnt, dried out sausage patties, completely undercooked eggs, and stale potatoes.  Went to work this morning hungry, exhausted, and extremely disappointed.  Would never stay here again and would not recommend anyone else say here either.  Filthy, old, unkempt mess."
0,"The name is fitting because that's what practically covered the joint. This place was empty when I visited. I got tumbleweed stuck in my hair. We had to invent people to talk too!\n\nNot the staff's fault, they seemed very nice. Just not a popular place anymore."
0,"I've eaten at here 15 -20 times since late 2009 or 2010. In the beginning, the food quality was excellent then it was sold or under went management change, I can remember the advertisement flyer. The last several times ordering take out has unacceptable in quality, this is not a place I'd recommend now."
1,"Prob the best buffet I've ever been to.   Yes, it's $63 dollars a person but where are you gonna get high quality buffet food?  I didn't have 85% of the offerings cuz I'm not a big eater BUT I was left stuffed full of tasty Hot BUTTERED crab legs.  Dessert offerings were also wonderful. Staff is super!"
0,I am very disappointed with the service that we received at Ashley. They use blatant bait and switch techniques. They advertised a special and then only have the piece available by order or in Casa Grande. Instead they try to push you toward another more expansive \nproduct in the store.   \n\nEverything that they sell is made after you pay  and they started by telling us that their warrantee covered anything that could happen to the couch. Until we brought up the BBB reports and complaints about their warrantee then they came clean about the real deal.  I just don't understand the predatory sales model and the desire to miss lead the consumer. It's sad because I really like their stuff.
1,"My boyfriend had brought a PM pizza home once a few months ago, and I was pretty impressed, so I decided to pick it up one evening after work when I didn't feel like cooking. It's a nice, small little store, and the guy at the register was patient with me as I figured out how to order. I got a pepperoni pizza with cheesy bread for about $12.  For the price, I think it's a pretty good deal. I definitely want to go back and try some of the other pizzas they have."
1,"This is SUCH a lovely place to have breakfast!! They get 5 stars based on their vanilla yogurt alone. It's deliciously creamy and it's filled with real vanilla bean seeds. Oh.my.goodness. And for a cup of this, priced the same as a glass of iced tea, it's a steal..\n\nMy husband said he's never had fresher tasting fruit in his fruit plate. \n\nThis place completely gets an A+ for their food. And while their prices are high, you are definitely getting your money's worth as far as quality of food and quality service. We went here a few times and really enjoyed ourselves."
1,"This is a great place. \n\nThey run amazing deals like GroupOn $5 for a movie ticket and soda (I don't recommend anyone drinks soda with HFCS), but I digress. They also have charity days where you can bring in a canned food item for free admission. \n\nNow, down to the nitty gritty. Nice theatre, much better than most brew and views I've been to. The seats could be more comfortable, they recline but then they bounce right back. The other seating is just like your computer office desk at home. The food is hit or miss. They failed to declare that the grilled cheese is actually more like american plastic cheese sandwich. The other food was good, but the service is rather fail. Ordered the 4 appetizer combo, and they came out with three items. Yet again no apologies, what is with service these days? \n\nThe screens are great and just like a regular movie theatre, it just sucks when they fail to dim the lights until half way through the movie. It makes the 3D glasses reflect like crazy. Overall it's worth a go, a bit pricy (for the food/drinks) but enjoyable none the less. I just bought 10 movie passes on GroupOn. Oh Yeah."
0,"Reluctantly!!! We just ordered pizza and chicken wings from Rosati's, Tempe. The last pizza was HORRIBLE!!! We thought we'd give 1 last try because we had some box tops for half off? We noticed we had a missed call from Rosati's? We thought it was to confirm our order. But it was a rude guy claiming his name was Scott claiming he was the owner and how did we collect 10 box tops?  We told him, \""by buying pizza?\"" He was rude and sounded like a drunk from the hood? Maybe this guy is having money problems or something? Do yourself a favor and AVOID SCOTT and all locations of Rosati's Pizza as this Scott guy was very unprofessional and If he is the owner we suggest he spend his time at AA, trying to make pizza,  and trying to get his customer service up to par from a ZERO! If we could give Rosati's a ZERO STAR we would!"
1,First time back at this restaurant in ten years (I used to live here back then).\n\nI am very impressed with how it's grow strong.  Didn't think of it at the time... but ordered pretty much the same dish as I did back in 2001 - monkfish skewers with beetroot coleslaw.  A thousand times improvement tasted.\n\nGuys well done and keep up the good work.\n\nNice decor and friendly service too.
0,"Wow. Bad.  Didn't even stay and order.  So excited for them to open and so totally disappointed in the interior and the menu. Ugh.  Hey people, this is North Scottsdale, not a college campus."
1,"Great service, Great food and Great Beer. I had a Heff that was awesome. My server recommended a turkey burger stuffed with cheese, basil, and kalamata olives topped with feta cheese with pesto aioli. AWESOMENESS. The atmosphere in and outside of the restaurant is great. Local shops are very cool and there is outdoor seating with a outdoor bar. The burger was $11 the beer was about $4. I liked it very much and will for sure go back again."
1,"Get the Dill Pickle +Jalapeno Ranch combo!\n\nI freaking love popcorn. Salty, sweet, butter, no butter, etc. etc. It's something about the texture, I think...and Popcorn Girl has great texture, AND flavor.\n\nMy friend and I got to try a few different flavors - ones we didn't purchase (but were just as good) were buffalo wings and loaded baked potato.\n\nPurchased:\n-Dill Pickle + Jalapeno Ranch (small: $4.75): the jalapeno ranch was a suggestion from the girl who filled our order, and I don't know who she is, but THANK YOU\n-Oreo (mini: $4.95): This was SO GOOD. Very rich so the mini size was perfect. I do have to say though after a couple of days (that included driving back from Vegas to LA = direct sun exposure) it tasted the best the day we bought it.\n-Denver mix (small: $6.95): the caramel in this is not my favorite, but I do like the white cheddar flavor - it isn't overwhelming. I wanted to compare this to the Garrett Popcorn mix from Chicago, and Garrett Popcorn wins this round for sure.\n\nHonestly - the 5 stars are for the dill pickle and jalapeno ranch (how many times have I typed out that flavor combination? getting redundant...) Based on the flavors I tried, I think they are on POINT with their savory flavors. The popped kernels aren't as big as Garrett Popcorn, but there is still great texture and I found very few unpopped kernels in the bags.  \nPrices were also very reasonable! the amount you get for the money you pay is honestly a really really good value. I'm seriously going to come here every time I'm in Vegas.\n\nI wish LA had some gourmet popcorn places like this (OTHER than over-priced and mass-produced popcornopolis)."
0,"My daughter and I decided to try Shiki one night since we recently moved to the other side of town and couldn't seem to find a Japanese Steakhouse close to where we live. The place was small, dark and not what I expected it to be. \n\nThe food was just okay, not all that great and service was kind of slow. I see there's a lot of good reviews on this place but I've been to many Japanese steakhouses and this one just didn't cut it for me."
1,I love this place!  They are always super friendly when we come in and the food is consistently delicious!  Not super expensive and great service!
1,"Another great lunch at Ray's - 2 slices with drink for $4.00.  Crust was just right with golden brown edges, nice crisp on the bottom, moist & chewy in the middle, and topped with a tangy tomato and milky mozzarella cheese.  Crust has a lot of residual flour on the bottom, which is perfect for me (and preferable to cornmeal).\n\nStaff are always friendly and the atomosphere has a NY-tribute theme going.  An older crowd was enjoying their slices at lunch today, which is perfectly fine with me."
1,"This place is awesome.  I brought my 2007 Jeep Cherokee because my brakes were making a squeezing noise.  The owner said that I just need back brakes and my front brakes had another 15k miles on them.  I will not go to another place.  If I had brought my car to another shop, they would have told me to change the front brakes too."
0,"The prices are the only thing that saves this lousy grocery.  I almost never go there.  I may if it is convenient.  I don't even go there to save money, which I we all could use in this day and age.  \nNo one seems happy at this place.  I once witnessed a jerk (check out person) yelling at a woman in line for using food stamps.  Otherwise they just scowl.\nThe store always seems cluttered and dirty.  Yeah, food is food but heck, life is too short to shop in a scuzzy grocery.  \nEven their adds suck!  They have \""better people\"" because they are \""employee owned\""?  Where is the logic in that?  There are plenty of very good people at the store I shop at and they are always friendly and even know who I am!  Wow!  What a novel concept!\nPhil Woodman is always touting some cheap mac and cheese, olive oil, or cereal.  Never mind that the stuff is bad for your health.  It's cheap!  Come on down, we will save you a buck and give you a coronary!\nAnyone who says this is a great store is only saying that the stores they are accustomed to are worse.\nI hate this place."
1,"Wow! Can you say pampered? \n\nBeautifully decorated inside to out. Nine pools that are 24 hours, which makes it a 5 star easily. The only thing that counters the 5 star review that makes me go back between 4 and 5 stars... is... NO WIFI? Apparently some rooms have it, and some don't. But for such a high class place with so many business guests, no wifi? It does seem a little ridiculous. But all the goods outweigh the bad (it's hard to find a 24 hour pool anywhere, let alone 9 24 hour pools). \n\nThe staff here go out of their way to be helpful. Very accommodating, very friendly, very available. Can't really ask for more... and I speak of the concierges and what I believe are managers that wander around helping guests. \n\nI would like to see more knowledgeable bartenders. I guess in such a nice hotel I'd expect a little older/experience bartenders as well as maybe valets. They were all really nice but it didn't really suit the rest of the hotel. But the patio that overlooks the pools is unreal, so nice to have a drink as the sun sets. \n\nThe cactus garden is really cool. Definitely worth taking a stroll through. Convenient parking.  \n\nWe went to the Il Terrazo (sp?) and the staff was really friendly. The food was really good but pricy. \n\nThe rooms are very nice, turndown service is a nice touch. The hotel is stocked with all the things you'd need for a stay - shampoo, conditioner (not the combined all in 1 that I loathe), q-tips, bath wash, body wash, shower caps, face pads, slippers, bath robe, soaps, mini bar (they even have a wine opener!). If you are coming from outside of AZ, bring your own water. The tap water isn't the best. \n\nThe have a bath tub and a nice walk in shower as well so you can bath how you like. The order in movies are a little pricey, they have flat screens but no DVD players. Room service is over priced, with a 22% gratuity automatically added and a $5 or something charge. \n\nThe good thing is it's in Scottsdale, near a lot of awesome places to see in Arizona!"
0,"While in the area I made it a point to stop in for lunch. I'll have to say I really like this place but I had to send my food back after waiting right at 20 mins for it! It wasn't hot and the cheese had just reached its melting point, and served on a cold platter and the food wasn't hot! \nI decided not to eat today! Maybe another day! \nI did share with manager on duty! Again I can only say if there is a problem or concern ask to speak with a manager!!"
0,Finding a good groomer is like trying to find a good mechanic or hair stylist its really hard! I saw this place numerous times since its across the street from my house so I decided to pop in. When I walked in I was not greeted and had to wait for the owner to get off the phone which was obviously a personal call. So I wait and browse. Finally about 10 mins later she asked if I needed help. I wanted to know how much an all over shave for my medium lenghth border collie lab mix would be. $110 bucks! Seriously? Seemed pretty steep. So I thank her and decide to buy some goodies for my chihuahua. When the owner asked what kind of dog I had while ordering the cookies she felt it was nessacary to ask why I would feed a chihuahua gourmet treats!! How is that any of her buisness??
1,"Came here for Brunch on Easter Sunday. Great service/ambiance. Our table ordered a fabulous cheese tray, hash, lox pizza, banana bread french toast. No one complained at all. So yummy and our server was great."
0,No thank you food was over cooked bland
1,"I tried this place in San Diego and they have it in VEGAS! After partying it up at XS, stopped by here to pick up some Adobada (spicy pork) tacos, carne asada fries, & a large horchata, hustled into the hotel room and started devouring these foodgasmic tacos. (Just sprinkle in some lime juice & hot sauce... tastes best mixed in with their green sauce). They use fresh potatoes for their carne asada fries and their meat is so tender & smoky.... OMG best thing ever especially when you need some hangover food haha."
1,I have had great experiences at the salon.  I'm surprised that this salon garners so many dollar signs...I've found them very reasonable w/ cost for cut/color and highlights.  \n\nMy fave stylist is Suzie - I know she will always have the latest in hair color/highlights as well as styles.  She really knows her craft and stays up-to-date with the trends!  I have also seen a couple other stylists at this salon and they are great as well.  The front office staff are always so helpful and friendly as well.  \n\nPlease check this salon out.
1,"Sunday Funday started out fabulously thanks to this amazing restaurant!\n\nWe started with an appetizer of chicken nachos... and MY GOD. The \""appetizer\"" was a plate big enough to feed three hungry females and STILL have leftovers. \n\nI'm super picky when I order anything and all of my orders end up being a complicated mess (Can you substitute this? Can I have this on the side? I need dipping sauce.) Our waitress - I'm so bummed I can't remember her name - was the sweetest lady. She was so patient with me and brought out the food exactly how I wanted to see it. Everything was incredibly delicious, too.\n\nThen, to top it all off, apparently they were closing early for their company holiday party. We started noticing people disappearing from the restaurant and we asked the manager if they were closing, to which he replied, \""yes, we closed at 2pm.\"" It was 3:30 when we looked at the clock and I couldn't believe it! They let us sit and enjoy our meal without making us feel rushed or even mentioning their early closing time. That was stellar customer service and I would give them 10 stars for that if I could.\n\nTry this place - you will LOVE it."
1,I adore the staff at this place!! Great food as well.
1,Open on a Sunday. Accepted walkins. Very accommodating. I was more scared than Luna. Dr Sibley and Chris loved on her. Kendra welcomed us. I didn't know what to expect since this was my first ever vet appt with my very first pet. Examination and shots were done on the floor where Luna was most comfortable. Didn't even need the table. Shots were a breeze. Very affordable for the reboosters. Will return to give the fecal. Four stars- no treat after the shots? Guess I should've brought my own
0,The worse service I've ever experienced. It too almost an hour to get our food and then my granddaughters pizza was cold. We sent it back and it took another 20 minutes.
1,The burger was cooked exactly as I asked for it - medium rare. Great fresh meat. Ordered the pineapple burger (can't remember the official name). Was a very cool sauce on it so highly recommend if you want a different take on the Hawaiian burger\n\nDownside was that it didn't come with fries or a side and the bartender didn't ask or say anything about it - guess I am just used to it. \n\nAs far as the beers - great selection and good knowledge base. Claim to be whiskey bar but have about 20-30; not awesome selection but solid. \n\nStrange neighborhood but well worth a visit if you are in town.
0,"Bad Food and Worse Service.  I don't think that they like or want customers.  We waited for 10 minutes to get seated, another 10 minutes for our waitress to come by and 40 more minutes for our food.  No explanation, no apology.  I'm not one who likes to complain but when I mentioned our disappointment to the night manager, he told me that if I didn't like my experience, I didn't have to come back.  I think I'll take his advice."
0,"I didn't actually stay here, I'm just reviewing the ambience. Nothing special about this hotel.It's a medieval theme. Nothing really classy about this hotel. It's kind of old school. I remembered staying here when I was a kid. It still looked the same.  My friend and I went to the arcade played a few games and left.  When we left the hotel, there were two weirdos handing out necklaces and asking my friend and I to take pics with them.. It's Vegas, weird things happens"
0,"I was dying for some drunken noodles, saw this place close and gave it a go.  They open at 11, I tried 1058, no one there realized how early and killed time at the dollar store, came back at 1114, still not open, started to leave and someone ran to the door to unlock it, still had her purse on so I know she just walked in the door.  I ordered takeout drunken noodles and asked how long it might be since I know they just walked in, 5 min.  I didn't know whether to be happy or scared.  How could that be ready in 5 min? It was obvious they took old stuff and just re fried it, pretty greasy and nothing tasted fresh.  I am not one to know authenticity, but I had some drunken noodles in San Diego that I am trying to find something similar here.  This is my 3rd round with the noodles and just a few other times eating Thai apart from that, but this was my worst for sure out of all of them.  I don't know Thai food real well, but I know fresh, and I didn't get anything fresh here.  Also, smelled like old lady moth balls"

0,"Very unprofessional and rude employees...I would not recommend coming here unless you want the most expensive car wash, an oil change, and your gas tank filled for $0.20/gallon more than Cobblestone Auto Spa. I politely cancelled my wash (due to the badgering for upgrades and oil change) and the woman did not remove the writing on my window, just wiped two streaks through it and made a few comments under her breath. They then asked me to park my truck across the street while I go inside and pay for the gas they pumped while we were talking, then I was asked to come find her outside and bring her the receipt. Even though this location is close it is far from convenient. ..two thumbs down."
1,"This isn't going to be much of a review because there isnt much to say... I don't want to act like I DONT frequent these types of estabishments - but for you people who know what a typical one is like then I have no problem with saying that this place is heaven.  Theres not need to be scared... they wont bite you, without a private room. \n\nI wish I could give more stars, as I've already given enough money to them. There must be at least 5 girls there that I've funded their entire college tuition.  Your welcome ladies.\n\n10 out of 5 stars...\n\n...and thats all I have to say, about that."
1,"Lots of cool stuff is marked down here.  I found a few cute pieces here like tank tops and even a cute dress.  I don't come in here looking for anything in particular, so I never know what I'm going to find!  I don't think I've ever paid more than $10 for a piece of clothing here!"
1,"I first heard about In the RA earlier this year during the Melrose Street Fair where they had a booth set up. I always wanted to try it but it wasn't until my friend Kim began to teaching there, that I went to support her. This was when they were at the 7th St location but I, like many of their students, have followed them to this new location. The new location is bigger (but beware that they are still in the middle of the new renovations) and boy, have their classes expanded!\n\nIn the RA offers Zumba, Zumba Toning, yoga, spin classes (bikes tilt 20 deg), Flirty Girl fitness, etc. Their website is very comprehensive and you can sign up for classes online and pay for your membership online. The studio also sells women and mens fitness clothes, accessories, shoes, etc. I bought some adorable/sexy Zumba tops that are very comfortable. \n\nOther than that, the other great thing are the owners, the instructors and the people that come there to work out. It is so laid back and everyone is having fun and happy to be there. Being that I have a gym membership and Bikram yoga pass, I often wonder how practical it is to frequent a 3rd place to work out. But every time I go, it reaffirms to me how special this studio is. So, even though I am the sporadic attendee, the girls always remember me and glad I came. Try In the RA and you will be welcomed with open arms!"
0,"$3 mixed drinks got us in.  The empty bar, techno music and lack of anyone else made us leave after our first drink.\n\nWalked by later.  Place was packed with girls sitting around and a bunch of dudes turning it out to Rihanna on the dance floor...not that there's anything wrong with that."
1,"I decided to give this place a try with a half price coupon I had in my Entertainment coupon book. My overall experience was very good. I was offered a complimentary beer when I arrived and had to wait almost no time for my turn. My stylist was friendly and talkative. Also, my haircut turned out great. Furthermore, I got some kind of mini facial, hand dip, and scalp massage which were all very nice.My only complaint was that I felt like I was at a sales presentation. With everything that she used she explained the benefits, the brand, and the price. I know that these places rely heavily on product sales, but I felt this was a over the top. My haircut was $20 with coupon which I felt was a fair price. However, I probably wouldn't spend $40 (normal price) for the same thing."
0,"We have been using this Metro since it opened and have seen a steady decline in food quality.  Today the dough was chewy, the sauce was thin with the result of a water drenched middle ; the peppers were uncooked and the spices were non existent.  VERY DISAPPOINTING on a day when we were watching the nfl playoffs.\n\nWe complained by phone to the manager who was only interested in us coming in to get our refund which defeats the purpose of home delivery. \n\nNEVER AGAIN!  They've lost us."
0,"Just got home from Opa and already writing a review... for a reason.  I don't appreciate the way I was treated this evening.  I came into Opa after purchasing a Groupon back in November.  After leaving a 12-hour day at work I had forgotten to print the Groupon, but of course I still pulled it up on my phone.  When the waiter came over to get the Groupon information he had another girl help him out... I handed the girl my Blackberry after pressing \""Use Groupon\"" and the screen came up with a bar code and code written underneath.  The girl held my phone for a good minute and said \""I don't know what happened, it just went back to the main screen.\""  My Groupon had been marked as used, which is what she intended to do... Then she told me she needed proof that it was marked as used this evening.  I went back to the \""redeemed\"" Groupons and showed her, but of course there was no date next to it.  After explaining to her that she had hit marked as used and I had brought up the bar code for her she refused to take it, and walked behind the bar to make drinks for another table.  When I turned around and looked at her she was defensively bitching to the staff about me as if I had been rude, when all I was trying to do was show her the \""redeemed\"" Groupons that I had.  I finally told them to forget it that we would pay full price and I would take it up with Groupon tomorrow to get my money back.  What a hassle after such a LONG day.  You'd think after all that they would at least comp us a dessert or glass of wine.    \n\nSO: 2 glasses of house wine, which were less than mediocre.. a \""combination plate\"" which was also less than mediocre, and a plate of lamb and potatos... which was also less than mediocre.  I would not rave about one thing about this place, I didn't enjoy a second of it.  (Not to mention, all of these less than mediocre items cost us a total of $75... I wouldn't have paid $30 for this awful experience) On top of the less than mediocre food, the waitress that was bitching about me and my Groupon circled our table, wouldn't make eye contact with me or my boyfriend, and had an awful look on her face.  Because of the Groupon situation she didn't refill our water until after our plates had been cleared!   I felt as if I was being mistreated and accused of LYING and trying to use a Groupon twice.  I wouldn't even go back to this place if they offered me a free meal because of this stupid situation.  The dinner was uncomfortable for the entire hour we were there and it wasn't even good.  Then right before we got the bill this awkward belly dancer came to our table and danced for us... Not gonna lie, she was also less than mediocre. \n\nAWFUL. AWKWARD. UNCOMFORTABLE. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!"
0,"Poor service at this location- we reserved a full size but they didn't have one. Luckily for them, someone had altered our res to a midsize, which they had. We had our confirmation but were told we could have changed our res after printing; essentially calling us liars. I almost got into it with two employees who acted like they were doing us a favor by giving us a car our baby seat could barely fit into. Wow, that was a terrible experience."
1,"Compendium is a new show at Planet Hollywood in which musicians pay tribute to legendary bands featuring live music, multimedia and acting during breaks in sets/costume changes. \n\nThe first band they're paying tribute to is none other than KISS so when I heard that I was all about it. One of my friends who came to town is a huge KISS fan. I arranged to take him along with some other friends to see the show. My entire party had a rockin' good time!\n\nThe Sin City Theater at Planet Hollywood is on the smaller side but it makes for a more intimate show. Seating was comfortable and waitresses bring drinks directly to your table. As far as I could tell, there wasn't a bad seat in the house.\n\nSome of the classics played were \""Calling Dr. Love\"", \""I Was Made for Lovin' You\"", \""New York Groove\"", \""Lick It Up\"", \""Shout It Out Loud\"" and \""Rock and Roll All Nite\"".\n\nLuis Reyes does an amazing job as Gene Simmons! That tongue... geez! I was the lucky recipient of a guitar pick from him when he threw it to me. Thanks Luis!\n\nAt the end of the show, the band stayed out on the red carpet to take photos with fans which I thought was a really nice touch. The entire band was very personable and friendly.\n\nYou can see the Sin City KISS show now through June 30th. Tickets are available on Ticketmaster here:\n\nhttp://www.ticketmaster.com/Compendium-tickets/artist/1996989\n\nThe next band featured will be U2 starting July 3rd."
0,"Ok, if you like canned chicken, no spices and little flavor, this is your place!\n\nThe chicken Tortilla soup was good, and the chips... The salsa and everything else was processed, canned, pre-made garbage!  Fuck this place and it's food!\n\nMiguel was very nice and the bathrooms are clean, but beyond saying hi to a nice waiter or pissing on clean porcelain, don't bother!"
0,"Food and drinks mediocre, service terrible. Once I asked the bar tender if they had cider, he said no, my friend points to the drafts and there was one on tap. I went with a group of friends and we sat in a round booth, the server was more interested in showing us her cleavage instead of good service. The cocktails here are too sweet. Their signature margarita is made from a mix, not from scratch, and it costs something like 12 bucks. Go to Mad Mex."
0,"The Cracked Egg is not the business. \n\nI found myself here for breakfast with a collegue with no real expectations as to what to expect. This is your run of the mill greasy spoon, common in the country's interior and you can tell that this is a locals favorite, for better or worse. They keep the restaurant very clean which is a plus and the service was friendly and warm.\n\nThe menu is extensive with all of the favorites well represented and after much consideration I decided to go light and try the Lowfat Scramble which combines Egg Whites scrambled with Chicken, Diced Green Chiles, Tortilla Chips and Salsa. The mouth feel of this dish is absolutely atrocious thanks to the soggy Tortilla Chips that they literally scramble with the rest of the ingredients. I had a hard time figuring out what was Chicken and what was Tortilla Chip until it was too late. Tortilla Chips should never be soggy, this you can trust.\n\nThis wins worst mouth feel award for 2014.   \n\nI may have ordered poorly and therefore would consider a repeat trip but for now I can only give 2 stars worth of bleh."
1,"I have never loved a haircut so much till I got here. I read reviews here on Yelp and they didn't disappoint at all. I called to schedule for Kim and she is the nicest hairdresser I've had in a while. It's so hard to find a good hair salon but thank goodness for Isis. Shampoo, haircut (layers & side bangs), blow dry, straightened and styled with my thick, frizzy, long, unhealthy hair for $30? I'll be coming here from now on. Thank you Kim!"
0,"I had seen some decent reviews on this place so I decided to hit it up. Not impressed. Was kind of expensive for the AUCE option, $25 a person as the selection looked like it was not very good. I went with ala cart and was not impressed with anything. It was all very sweet with sauces and just not high quality. Would not repeat and I should know better hitting a place on the strip like that! LOL.. worth a try.."
0,"I could give this a 0 star if I could.\n\nSo they pulled me aside to question me about my year of graduating high school, etc. etc., procedures for a fake I'm guessing & threatened to call the police & confiscate my only ID if I didn't \""tell the truth\"" so I was forced to make up a fake birthday by saying I was 2 years younger in order to get my ID back & was told to leave the grounds. This was also for an event I had already pre-paid $50 for.\n\nEven worse, my friend who merely two days later with an actual FAKE ID who, although she is 20, looks far from it managed to enter the same venue for another pre-paid event. I thought Las Vegas, out of all places, would be used to properly identifying people of drinking age.\n\nOf course, I came back and watched the show from another pool but I suggest either getting better security guards who can actually distinguish fakes from real and maybe even buy, god forbid, a black light or ID scanner - because for a major company that would be so expensive!\n\nOne last thing, I was threatened to be blacklisted from all MGM owned places (which apparently is 75% of the Strip). I really don't care about any of these places so their words fell empty and I just felt harassed for absolutely no reason. Good job taking my money and leaving me without an experience I had been waiting for for months."
0,This is a great concept and works well if you're flying out of terminal 3 or 4. If you're flying out of 2 this is such a pain! The train does not have a terminal 2 stop but the shuttles will not take you to the east economy lot from T2 so you have to take a shuttle to terminal 4 then catch the train from there. Sounds easy unless you're dragging luggage up and down stairs like I was. Took me 45 min to get to my car after the plane landed. I'm hoping the phoenix city council is working to fix this problem. Use Blue Sky if you're using terminal 2. Way easier!
0,Decent pad thai. They had their kids in the restaurant and they were loud.
1,We like this movie theater.  It's always clean and never crowded.  Movie prices suck of courseBut if you go before noon is not to bad.  Get the cup I'd you come more than twice.  It's worth it.
0,"Not worth the money or the wait in line. I went to the buffet for Brunch on a Saturday... The food was just \""ok\"". It was edible, but nothing to go run home and tell your mother about it. The waffles were too hard and dry. The meats were extra fatty and very rare. The eggs were super runny. The breakfast sausage was good, but that's pretty hard to screw up. The pizza was ok too. The muscles were dry. The king crab legs were ok for buffet standards. The pork belly was juicy & delicious, They did not have too many options for desserts, just your standards, I tried almost one of everything but was only happy with the keylime tart. \n\nOverall I think the Belliago Buffet is more on the old school vegas vibe. With standard options. The newer hotel buffets on the strip (i.e. Cosmopolitan, Aira, etc) seems to give not only the standards but different variations of them as well as providing other unique options for the same price as this buffet."
0,"I've dined at House of Leng numerous times, as it is conveniently located across from my office park. I am not an advocate of this place, as the food here is less than average. The quality is fair/average; however, the food is not pleasant or tasty. \n\nI really wanted to enjoy this place because of its convenience. I've eaten here about 5-6 times with co-workers and ordered different dishes each time. It's doubtful that I will return here unless attending a group luncheon."
1,First timer staying here and have to say that their customer service at registration and the central bar was awesome!! They were super accommodating and made our first few moments at this hotel wonderful! What a lovely way to start a vacation.
0,"i was not at all impressed with marrakech. i will give it two stars for the very cool, tent-like atmosphere, the yummy hummus and the free bottle of wine. otherwise... meh. the lentil soup tasted canned, the bread was dry and the chicken and couscous they served us at the end was tasteless.\n\nthey also have a belly dancer who will come up to your table, wiggle around and stare at you while you are either trying to eat your food or converse with your dining companion. i didn't want to be rude and ignore her, but other people were tipping her and i felt awkward paying attention and smiling politely while she danced around our table without giving her a tip, which would have made me feel creepy, like i was at a strip club or something... maybe i am just too awkward for this place."
1,"the lobster cheese fries were so delish! the drinks were good, the prices were just fine, and the burger was too juicy to pick up. knife and fork it, baby!"
1,"We were delirious.  \n\nWe were hungry. \n\nWe were in the Monte Carlo. \n\nD.Vino looked like a good option.\n\nThe space is cute and inviting.\n\nOur server Michael was great.  He was kind, attentive, and on point with his suggestions.  \n\nThe food was hot, fresh, and tasty.  Great thin crust pizza, ice cold water, and good table bread for picking before dinner.  \n\nPricing was fair, and we left happy!"
1,"America, except California apparently, runs on Dunkin'. \n\nSurprisingly, this Dunkin' Donuts is one of the closest ones to many of us from Southern California. There's one just south of the Las Vegas Strip in Nevada, but on the Arizona side, this has to be it. Though there's one on the naval base at Camp Pendleton near San Diego, private citizens can't go onto the campus, so it essentially is inaccessible for about 95% of the population. It almost makes one want to join the military, actually.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, and as crazy as it sounds, this Dunkin' is one of the closest ones to the people of the Los Angeles region.\n\nI spent the past Thanksgiving weekend in Phoenix, and I stopped by here each morning as part of my ritual whenever I visit a city where Dunkin' Donuts flourish. I would get up before the rest of my family, and enjoy a donut and regular coffee (raspberry, creamed and sugared), as the crowds and lines would slowly start to form. If you follow my reviews, this crowding after I arrive always occurs whenever I visit a restaurant or establishment, and it happened each morning during the Thanksgiving weekend here. \n\nOnce my order was claimed, I always insisted on eating there, as I don't like eating in my vehicle, or really having food in it. There is a drive-thru here, however, for those that don't care for the interiors of their cars. I do like how this location delegates the coffee making responsibility to others, and to have you pick up your order off to the side; it makes for faster overall service with the rest of the queue.\n\nI'm actually one of those people who always completes those surveys on the receipts so as to get a free donut on my next visit. Considering that I essentially swing by each day, doing those surveys is essentially a 50% discount off my bill each visit, and I really only pay for the coffee. It's made even easier if you have a smart phone and can do it on the spot. I know what you're thinking...what about that last receipt before you went back to California? Did you do that survey? The answer is: Yes. And it's folded and in my wallet, ready to be brought out the next time I encounter a Dunkin' Donuts location. \n\nThe tax here is generally lower than what I experience back in California, so whatever few cents it saves me in sales tax is always welcomed, even if I can't really compare it with another California Dunkin' Donuts. I did notice that the prices for milk and water in the refrigerator were too high, however (even by Los Angeles standards). Then I realized that because this is some of the hottest deserts in the country, water may be more of an expensive thing around these parts.\n\nThe service, was very attentive and great. The donuts I sought were always in stock and tasted fresh. You can tell a good quality donut because you never see cracks in the glazing. I only wish that they install a television, set to the news or something entertaining, so that diners could have something to look at other than their phones or other people.\n\nSpeaking of which...on a side note, while visiting here, I was keenly aware that I was the only Asian person here each time (and probably the only one on any given day). Though I was aware of it, it was kinda interesting seeing how other customers looked at me. It could have also been the way I parked the car (which was fast and with California plates), dressed (which was business-like, but wouldn't draw a second glance in Los Angeles), or had brief verbal exchanges (but polite). Children especially, who haven't yet learned the art of discretion, essentially gawked at me and were surprised at my \""Californian accent\"" (we don't actually have one) and how tall I was for an Asian. (I did notice I was consistently one of the tallest people there each morning, which isn't saying much, because I'm of average height around Southern California). I knew this because I could hear them \""whispering\"" it to their parents, who would reply back to them that I'm probably visiting from out of town. \n\nI just laughed, looked at the parents, and replied, \""cute kids.\"""
1,"As far as Chinese places in this area , I think this is one of the best. Their food is less greasy than wang and king and they are very fast and affordable . Had way better Chinese food in Florida and the UK to be honest but for around here this place can't be beat...   (:"
0,Extremely dirty. Could have sworn I saw cockroaches running around. Smelled like sewer. However staff was really friendly.
1,"Everything the last woman said is 100% true but, Clarence Vastine MD works for Megan and he is awesome. I HATE Dr.'s with a passion, but he is an informative and knowledgeable Dr. The staff is horrible but once you get past them Dr. Vastine is great. I have been to dozens of Dr.'s in the past 2 years and 90% of the ones I've been to have HORRIBLE staff, so you just have to find a good Dr. you like. Dr. Vastine comes highly recommended by me!"
1,"Went for the free \""Movies in the Park Free Family Movie Series\"" last night and really enjoyed myself. The park has a giant inflatable movie screen where they show family movies every Friday night at 7 in the early spring months. \n\nGet there early to get a spot closer to the screen and bring a picnic blanket to relax on. It got a little chilly later in the evening, I would bring a blanket to snuggle under too."
1,"I love the new location. I know, I know, everyone has been talking about it for years. I live in the 'hood, and didn't much like the old location. Walking into a cafe, only to see a sea of laptops, isn't very welcoming. Not their fault, of course.\n\nThe new location offers up some tasty treats. I've had a few of the breakfast and lunch items. \n\nIt can be a bit confusing to find it at first. You have to go in the back door. (Hahahahaha you know what *I* am thinking, right?) Picking up your order is tricky, because it gets loud in there and you may not hear your name called.\n\nI prefer the back (front) room. Less traffic, and there's a cool bar to sit at."
1,This place has:\n\n- Pulled pork sandwiches.\n- Artisan Roast coffee.\n- Nick Cave playing in the background.\n\nNeed I say more?
1,Orange chicken is the best
1,"Awesome, awesome, awesome! First of all, I don't just live in Maricopa...I live WAY out at a pretty far point in Maricopa.  But, he came with no complaints and no extra charges.  Second, he did such an incredibly thorough job on my cat pee stained carpets that they look amazing.  He went over each inch several times and even got down on his hands and knees occasionally to check the smell.  He also did a loveseat that was covered in cat hair and it looks brand new.  Third, he was so reasonably priced that I feel he may have undercharged and I feel a little guilty with as much work as he did.  Bonus:  left a bottle of spot cleaner and shoe coverings to protect the floor while it dries.  \n\nWe've used two other companies before and were left with \""crunchy\"" carpets afterwards or just sub par results that left me feeling like I could've done a better job myself with one of those rentals from the grocery store.  I will use and recommend Robert again and again.  Plus, it is just so nice to receive good customer service rather than having some kid who just wants to hurry up and finish the job."
0,"here is the deal,  do not ever waste your time or money with alex. we took a 1987honda elite 150 that ran,! he said we needed a new engine but afterward, we would have 'no problems' $750 later we drove away and made it less than a mile before it broke down. took it back, waited two days, got the scooter back and it ran for a day. he burned up the battery and we had to buy a new one which is useless now cause we have no scooter. alex is a pure piece of shit. his trashy woman is crap herself. i will never stop trying to put these scammers out of business. never even think of going to alex repair shop. peace"
1,"I've used this hotel for years through work and have always had a positive experience.  Free WiFi, great front desk staff, big rooms and easy access to the great city of Madison. \n  I tend to be very hard on hotels but this one always leaves me satisfied."
1,"I came here for my birthday and it just so happens to be a Mexican holiday so I guess the buffet price was a bit more than usual. I came at 2:30pm on a Saturday and paid $55. I had to wait in line for about an hour. \n\nWhen I finally got seated, my friends and I didn't know where to start! There was soo many selections and everything looked delicious! I went for the king crabs and oysters! They tasted so fresh and easy to eat.\nI ate my money worth here and my favorite part was the dessert section! They had macarons and ice cream, and you can even make your own crepe! I was so full from eating all the food but always have room for dessert. \nThis place did not disappoint. I would defiantly come here again and try some other foods that I didn't get to try."
0,"I find myself here nearly every other week because of the Target/PetSmart combo conveniently located by my job. I really loathe it. Overdone design, creepy constant music, the fact that the mall's outdoors, terrible parking lot planning....\n\nOh. And it shoots lasers.\n\nSeriously.\n\nLasers! Are you freaking kidding?!? I guess this falls under \""overdone design.\""\n\nI have had surprisingly good experiences at the movie theater here, though. There are a lot of teens, but for some reason they seem to misbehave less at Tempe Marketplace than at Chandler Fashion Square. Maybe I've just been lucky."
0,"I used to know a Canadian who would brag that this place had the best ribs.  So of course, when I made a trip up there from the States, I had to check it out.  As soon as I walked in, I noticed the pictures of all the celebrities, mostly hockey players, who visited over the years.  So I thought to myself, this place must be as good as advertised.  \n\nI ordered the Whole Hawg, which is a full rack of ribs.  All I can say is these are the worst ribs I have ever eaten.  What the hell is that diarrhea they glazed the ribs with?  I'll tell you what it was.  It was a low quality soy or teriyaki sauce mixed with honey.  The whole thing was a dark and sticky mess that tasted like really bad Chinese or Japanese food served at a cafeteria.  And if that wasn't bad enough, the meat was greasy.\n\nEverything is cooked on a gas-fired rotisserie, so I wouldn't really call this BBQ.  At least not the American standard for BBQ.  But if this is Canada's idea of BBQ, they can keep it.\n\nThe poulet was only a little better than the ribs, but not by much.  With such lousy food, I can't believe this place has been around for so long."
1,"I went to OHYA with my boyfriend, mostly because I like Japanese and Korean food and they serve both!\n\nI decided on one of the specials that included a meat choice and 2 regular sushi rolls or 6 nagiri. I got the bulgogi for my meat choice, then s spicy tuna roll and a California roll. We also ordered the vegetable tempura as an appetizer.  Everything I put in my mouth that night was super yummy! I hadn't had any Asian food for a while and OHYA really hit the spot!\n\nJust writing this review made me crave them, so I'll definitely be going back again soon to try some other wonderfully sounding option on their menu!"
0,"This place used to be so much fun.  Good food.  Good service.  Not anymore.  The local neighborhood feel is gone.  No more \""people knowing you name\"".    This might as well be another link in a chain restaurant.   Food is still pretty good.  Service is beyond terrible.  So sad to see what was a great place just be so-so."
1,"Always a pretty good time at Zipps.  Friendly staff, fun atmosphere, good food, cheap pricing.  The 1000 Island burger is awesome.  Had this with the side salad & then we had a chocalate chip cookie pie that is served on a hot skillet with ice cream on top.  As bad as this is for you the thing taste absolutely amazing!  The only draw back to Zipps is you seat yourself & the majority of the time the place is packed so your forced to walk around a crowded bar looking for somewhere to sit.  Anytime I want to watch a game, relax, & have some good fair priced food this is a definite option."
1,We have been taking our lab to barkin babies and he looks great every time!  He seems to enjoy going there too.  They always follow our instructions to the T.  Would completely recommend it.
0,"The quality of the cleaning is good, but we have had issues with service/misplacement of items. On one occasion, they lost my husband's pants. They eventually gave us a replacement check, but it took several times of back and forth communication in order this issue to be resolved. I'm sure that had I not been persistent, nothing would have been done.\n\nOn another occasion, I realized that one of my favorite blouses was no longer in my closet. Initially, the person who worked there (someone who I didn't see very often) said she didn't know what to do and that it wasn't in their \""left over\"" area. I was super frustrated, and she just didn't have to skills to deal with the situation. Against my better judgment, I returned the following week with more dry cleaning. The girl who is usually there recognized me and took my order. I then asked her about the blouse. She exclaimed that they had the blouse and that, somehow, it had gotten separated from the rest of the order. \n\nOn yet another occasion, I picked up the regular order, and the attendant grabbed a shirt separate from the order and added it to my pick-up. Yes, another instance of a shirt getting separated, and no one tells me!\n\nToday was the last straw-we had received an email for a double-coupon promotion. The regular attendant said I had come in a day early for the promotion, but that she will submit the order the following day, along with the promo code. I picked up the order this afternoon, and I just had a hunch that I should check if the promo code was applied. Another new attendant was there, and he pretty much said he didn't know what to do and that he was new there. No, \""Let me take down your info and get it to someone.\"" Nothing. No remorse. No concern that the order wasn't entered correctly. \n\nAgain, quality was fine. But the customer service is horrendous. Only one person seems adequately trained to handle any issues. I am now in search for a new, reasonably-priced and professional dry cleaners."
0,"My friend and were guest at the MGM,we checked in Thursday and stayed until Sunday. Friday we went to the wet republic were my friends purse was taken,we spent about 3 hours filling reports etc...my friend needed to buy new makeup because it was in the purse,when she went to buy new makeup she told a lade that worked at the MGM that her credit card was canceled because her purse was taken, we received a phone call that we need to check out of the hotel because they assumed we had no method of payment .We went to talk to the people at the check out desk to ask why they would check us out with out talking to us ,all they said was basically to bad for us. We payed for our stay in cash ,it was not a problem to do so .THe people at the hotel were os no help to help us find the purse, all they car about is them self,and if we had no cash we would of been out on street,everything was in the purse ATM cards create cards etc.... This is just not write the security at the hotel dropped the ball at the pool, and then they want to kick us out!!!! I will never stay at the MGM.\nAlso they over crowd there clubs, service sucks,and you can't even get water, they make you buy it for$6 a bottle, it's so hot water should free!!"

0,"I am writing this review from the front bench of this restaurant. This experience was horrible which is sad from an establishment like Hash House. We got to the restaurant at 3:30, in between lunch and dinner and we were forced to order from the brunch menu. My sister does not eat eggs and asked if she could have the dinner chicken and biscuits. She was told no and that the closest thing was a Benedict dish. She said can I get it without the eggs. The waitress said that their dishes were works of art and nothing could be removed or substituted. My brother in law wanted a biscuit, since we were outside of dinner, he was denied an order of biscuits, even after we offered to pay for them since it was his birthday. Overall, this experience made his birthday one we will always remember due to the unprofessional behavior of its servers, its inflexibility of its chef and the poor times of its menu window. It's such a shame that Hash House has been brought to this level since by the pictures in the lobby, they were amazing!"
1,Service at local was excellent and friendly. The eggs Benedict was amazing and had a nice take with the asparagus and potato pancake addition. Excellent home fries with red peppers and onion. Would definitely recommend and go again.

0,"The two stars are for Vinnie - he's pretty funny! Most of the jokes I have heard before.. but it was still a good time and kudos to him for working seven nights a week. The reason why I couldn't give any more stars is because I felt like the \""free\"" tickets we received was a total ripoff. Basically we got two free tickets but they have a $16.99 one drink minimum per person. It took the waitress 40 minutes to take our drink order in a small room, and the show was only about an hour or an hour and a half. I found myself searching for the waitress the whole first half to \""make sure I got my monies worth\"" instead of relaxing and enjoying the show. $16.99 is pretty steep, especially since you only get one, and you can only choose from beer, wine, or well. You get those for free when you sit down in the casino! I tried to order a seven and seven (which is well in other bars) but they said no. We both ended up getting a vodka cranberry and it came in a tiny glass full of ice and bright red (i.e. no booze). So sad. AND they don't let you bring in your drinks even though you already pre-paid for one. I really could have used my wine they made me throw away outside :/.\n\nSummary: LOVED Vinnie, strongly disliked the service. In the end it really felt like we got screwed with the \""free\"" tickets and joke of a drink. I wouldn't recommend anyone to see this show. Maybe buy one of his dvds instead and watch it in your room with a bottle of wine!"

1,"Vets can be a touchy subject.\n\nOver the weekend, we were having dinner at a friend's house, who has nearly a dozen rescued animals.  She and her husband are quiet sane, but generous to a fault.  If, that is a fault.  I noticed they had three of the four James Herriot's  \""All Creatures Great and Small\"" novels on the book case.  It got us to talking about our wee beasties and the doctors who care for them.\n\nOne of the ongoing themes in the novels is Vet Siegfried Farnon's rants about the cheapness of the folks who live in the Yorkshire Dales.  Well, not a lot has changed for Vets or animal owners I guess.  \n\nWe are always looking for the most competent, least expensive way to care for our pets.  And, when we find a good one, for the most part you want to keep it a secret.  Some can be prone to expensive tests or procedures, while others can balance common sense and reasonable care given the pet's age, et cetera.\n\nWe have tried other Veterinaries and animal hospitals in the valley, but we keep coming back for that fine balance and love that Horizon and it's staff shows to our wee beasties!"
1,"My husband and I have been here 4 times in the last 2 years and each time it was wonderful.  We have always had great service and the food is divine.  I actually crave the house dressing they have!!!\n\nMy favorite is the crab and scallop stuffed lobster.  It is so tasty!  Love the atmosphere, it's where we go for special dates.  The wait staff cracks your crab legs and lobster for you - that rocks.  At the end of the meal they bring you warmed moist lemon towels to take the sea food smell off of your hands.\n\nThe only negative:  they charge for refills of sodas.  Order water instead."
0,"Second time here after a day of golfing. Food is okay, prices okay. Major complaint is service. This is a pub, and it took 20 minutes before someone came to our table and asked if we wanted some drinks. It happened.both times. The place was 75% full, not over packed. Service was so slow and hard to get, i don\""'t think i would come here again."
0,"I had not been to this place since Chef Silverman left, as we used to go all the time.  It was terrible.  The first server we had forgot to send over the bread and never bothered to tell us the specials.  Then he spilled tobasco sauce all over my husband's leather jacket and sweater, and he just walked away, and when we called him back, he \""poo-pooed\"" it, and said he will \""dry \"" him up, brought two napkins and patted the jacket down and my husband's body down.  You could smell the tobasco sauce, and he just said that he got it all, but you could see it on the jacket, so I asked for a manager.  The manager came over, and admitted the server had an attitude, and gave me his card, and told me to get the jacket and sweater dry cleaned and to bring him the bill.  He also said he would take care of us, and provide us with another waiter.  Dinner went on.....came time for dessert, and I couldn't decide between two desserts, so the new server suggested the upside apple cake, but said it would take 8 mins, and we asked to have our coffee with the dessert.  After about 15 mins, the server came back with the coffee, and said the dessert chef got behind so it will take a minute more, but he decided to bring our coffee.  Now 15 mins later, so a total of 30 mins now, we have finished our coffee, and here comes the waiter with our apple dessert and the other dessert we asked about but did not order, he said the manager said to bring both.  We waited and finally asked for the check, and the waiter said the manager took off the appetizer (cheese plate, $15) and the cheesecake dessert, the alternate dessert that we did not order, but charged us for the dessert we ordered.  I then went to the manager, and he said that was not right, he told the waiter to take off the appetizer, and the dessert, and I told the manager, but I only ordered one dessert, it wasn't my idea to bring the cheesecake dessert also.  So they ran a credit on my husband's credit card for the first check with the dessert, and took off the dessert, and then ran it again.  First, of all how are you not charging me for a dessert I didn't order, and really for all that trouble, and spilling tobasco on my husband, that is the only compensation, $15 cheese platter, and a $8 dessert?  We will definitely not be going back there, with all the better restaurants out here in Summerlin."
1,"Came for lunch today with a friend.  We both wanted at least 2 rolls and didn't want to go broke paying for them.  Quality was good. Service was a little slow.. there was only 1 waitress hopping between all of the tables, and they were all filled up by the time we were done eating.\n\nWe both had AYCE for $19 with an iced tea each.  With tax it came to $22.11.  I ordered a 911 roll, shrimp tempura roll and a spider roll.  All 3 were very good.  Wish I had saved money for tempura ice cream.  I'll be coming back for dinner which is $22 for AYCE with my husband one night in the future."
0,"Erm, this place is closed or out of business? I went there yesterday about midday. All I saw inside was a painter's bucket and a couple of office desks. Their website says they're \""Now Open!\"" but unless they've moved (there was no sign indicating this) the place doesn't exist."
1,"i really think this hotel deserves a lot higher rating than it has. maybe all those yelpers lost some money at the tables and are holding a grudge. i lost some money here too, but i can't help myself still loving this place so much. the rooms are clean and spacious, and most importantly cheap!!! especially on those busy summer weekends when you want to do an impromptu trip to vegas, this is the place to stay. \n\nthey have a movie theatre, bowling alley, and all my favorite table games. the table minimum bet is lower than the strip too. also, you don't have to deal with all the traffic with the strip. all the coast casinos have a bus that drives for free to the strip so that you dont have to deal with that hassle. also don't forget to get the player's card, you lose enough money and they'll definitely bring you back for free!\n\n\n\n\nedit***the only drawback is the pool isn't as cool as some of the pools on the strip. hint: go sneak into the nice pools on the strip (caesars, mandalay, mgm, etc)"
0,I called and didn't even bother leaving a message after reading the reviews. If you advertise that you are open then you may want to consider answering your phone. You just lost another customer.
0,"I've been to this location 4 times and will never go back. I've been to the east side location on Monona Dr twice, and absolutely LOVE it! Clearly different owners and standards of service. \n\n1) West side has a male employee who is completely rude. He doesn't make eye contact, he's annoyed when he gets customers (I have been there twice with my friend, twice alone), he's in a huge hurry. Once another employee came in and even they didn't speak to each other. He's just rude. \n\n2) Lots of ingredients are an extra charge. All you might hear is, \""that's a dollar fifty extra, that's fifty cents extra.\"" Not much friendliness happening over there. East side makes it totally pleasant! I'm not sure how, but part of it is just being super friendly and they seem so happy to see you!\n\n3) East side is so busy they have four people behind the counter. They welcome your arrival, smile, are engaged and always have customers. They wear cool uniforms, and everyone says, \""thank you!\"" As a group when they hear you leave a tip. \n\n4)West side uses teaspoons to serve extras, east side uses a spoon larger than a Tablespoon. So for example, I might get 6 cranberries on my Strawberry salad cause of the size of the spoon. East side? 15 cranberries. When I said something to the west side guy, he scoffed and said it would be an extra charge and east side isn't the same place. Pecans? West side a few crumbs, east side? At least 8 nice sized pecans. \n\nI've talked to three people so far who have the same to say about this guy and location. We all understand why the place is always empty. Who wants to be an unwelcome customer paying over 10 bucks for a salad? I would rather go to the Copps salad bar and get my own for less than $7 bucks. Thank goodness, I live on the west side but WORk on the east side, so if I want Salad Creations, I can go to Monona Drive and pay $10 for a salad, and I feel really good about being in there! So much positive energy!"
0,"the worst food we have seen in scottsdale!  no other dinners on busy restaurant week! our food was horrible seafood not fresh.\nwaitress seemed to be busy drinking with what seemed to be a few regular bar patrons.... nice location but don't waste your time. guess it will be closed soon , don't fall for a groupon, or living social.!!!!"
0,"Classic SE Charlotte hangout.  Think AppleTini & Harpers with a cooler interior. Bit pricey, although consistent food.  Truffle oil on French Fries.  Aoili & Flat bread.  Foodie need not apply.  BTW, same restaurant group as Harpers."
1,"I didn't get a chance to try the food here because they weren't serving any food when I went. Lets see, Summer 2010, FIFA World Cup. Robbie Fox was one of the few guys willing to open up his shop at 5:30 for soccer. Awesome.\n\nWe just ordered a few drinks, and watched the game it was Netherlands vs Sweden I think, and there were some crazy dutch guys there. Made the atmosphere pretty cool. Nice place to catch a game.\n\nApparently there was gonna be food here when they opened, but there never was. It was a perpetual waiting game, and it was always like, \""yeah, the food/cook is gonna be here in 5 minutes\"". Eventually, the game ended and yeah, no food. Poor customer service in my opinion, if you say there is gonna be food there should be food. I'll try it some other time if I get the chance."
0,"I stopped by to get some coffee and snack at the center bar. The bartender was loud and awkward in his behaviour ignoring me for the first 5 minutes. He was definitely under the influence. Finally he asked me what i needed (!) I asked him if he could make a cup of iced latte and after the positive answer, ordered such. He made hot coffee, dropped couple ice cubes in it, added milk - that was his definition of ice latte. I didn't want to make a big deal, paid, took my coffee and left. On the way out I sipped my coffee hoping it was ok, but it was disgusting colored water. I had to come back and asked the bartender if he could make another normal one. He turned red, and loudly in aggressive manner was demanding answers what was wrong with the coffee he made. I explained to him after what he yelled in my face i should go get coffee somewhere else. He throw couple dollar bills at me screaming \""you can go and have it on me\""...i actually paid for it (!) I did let him know he is out of control and rude asking to speak to his manager. He yelled me \""And who are you for me to do so?\"" He took a business card out of the pocket throwing it at me, saying \""here, come and visit me!\"" \nThe following day i got a hold of the general manager of double Helix bar and boutique. She seemed to be aware of the situation but expressed very little interest at hearing it from me. There was simply no appology. I made it very clear I didnt come to ask for any accommodation from them, but wanted the bartender to be held accountable for his unappropriate insaulting behaviour. The manager refused to contact the owner and refused to provide me with his contact info. \nThe following day, I was reading some Vegas magazine and ran accross an article about Double Helix and the owner. From that article I got his name and decided to try my luck by emailing him at the address combined in several variations of his first and last name at doublehelix website, hoping he wasn't aware of the situation but can satisfy my request. \nSuprisingly i got an answer from him in a day or so. It was full of protection for his bartender, indicating how great he was and hinting how much i was wrong and unappropriate (!) Are you kidding me?! Big spendings or not, i was a customer! I thanked Mr Nisi for his time but let him know i will use my way for the truth to come out planning on writing the review at least. In return, Mr Nisi got a hold of my employer making up false accusations and saying i was threatening him. Sure, if writing a review is a threat!...I believe i have all rights to do so. It wasn't a threat, it was a promise. \nThe lesson of my story is - there are retailers, bartenders, owners of businesses, people working in customer service who does judge you by the way you are dressed and how much money you spend. They are not willing to take care of you even though it is their job and they are paid for it! We, customers, pay for it. And I refuse to pretend it is ok the get this kind of service in \""high-end\"" place. Wine, dinner, coffee, or water, doesn't matter. And no matter how wonderful Double Helix may sound on their main web page, the reason to have a rude bartender, it is because it is allowed for him to be so, it is beacuse the owner himself exactly like that! Simply a jerk"
0,"I am sad to have to write this review, since I love finding great businesses\nand deals to share with friends/family/etc. Unfortunately, I will NOT be\nrecommending Simplicity Laser to anyone. In fact, I will be warning people\nNOT to waste their time and/or money there. I purchased a Groupon about a\nyear ago for laser hair removal treatments. I have done laser hair removal\nbefore at Advanced Laser Clinics and got awesome results. I have several\nfriends and family members who have also had laser hair removal done at ALC\nas well as other places. All of them have had great results as well. So, I\nam no stranger to laser hair removal and how it works. So, my groupon was\nfor 8 treatments, with 4-6 weeks between each treatment. I spent the last\nyear of my life driving 40 minutes to and from Simplicity Laser (in\nGlendale) every 4-6 weeks. I have been finished with my treatments now for\nabout a month. I literally can't tell any difference in the amount of hair I\nhave in the treated area. I will generously say that i have had MAYBE 10-20%\nreduction. This is absolutely NOT typical and unacceptable. I mentioned my\nconcerns several times during my appointments and was blown off each time. I\ncalled to speak to a manager and was told that I should make a \""client\nreview\"" appointment to discuss my results and a possible resolution. I had\nmy \""client review\"" today and was basically blown off again, and told that\nthey weren't going to do anything to help me unless I purchased more\ntreatments. Basically, this company gets you in the door with, what seems\nlike, a good deal...and then treats you at a low level on the machine...all\nthe while trying to sell you more treatments. A good company will treat you\naggressively with the machines, so that you see results. And then you'll\ncome back to them because they work. I am very disappointed in this company\nand their business ethic, customer service, etc."
1,"If someone were to ask me about the best thing I've recently ate, I'd say it's Banzo's falafel. \nI didn't have them in pita. Just the balls a la carte.\nNow I get why people love this place. These super fluffy inside, crispy-outside falafel are the best that I've ever had anywhere. I thought I had sampled some of the finest falafel a from SF Bay Area to Paris, but I am happy to report that Banzo's falafel wins the title of \""the best.\"""
0,"Mediocre. We came here wanting to have an ice cream on the strip and eat outside to people-watch in a cheerful-looking place. We were told there was a 20-minute wait, so we went out back to their to-go line. I tried to order a root beer float, but they told me I could only order that in the restaurant, although they had it on tap outside. My husband tried to order an Oreo sundae, but they were out of Oreos, and just about everything else on the menu other than a couple items. Must be good, you think? Not so much. They charged us $1 each for tap water and $12+ for the sundae. I had to wait so long for the ice cream that my tap water was empty by the time my food was ready. I asked them for a refill of tap water, and they said they can't do that; I must have given the eyebrow because she agreed to do it this once... For a mediocre $12 sundae and $3 worth of tap water, one would hope they could refill a TAP WATER. The ice cream wasn't even good enough to hold my five-year-old's interest. They no longer have the fish tank featured on Tanked, either. This place is not up to Las Vegas strip standards."
0,"I'm 100% Italian-American. I grew up on Italian, home-cooked food, I've spent a month in Italy and literally ate my way through the country, and have an eleven-letter Italian last name that people constantly butcher when they try to pronounce it.  It is that experience that prompted me to sign up for Yelp and give Battista's its deserved one star. It was dismal. \n\nThe main reason I am writing this is to dispel myths circling around (from LOCALS no less) that this place is fun and has good Italian food. Neither is true. Though our wait staff was attentive and prompt, the good service we got just didn't outweigh the bad food. \n\nThe decor is kitschy - crap all over the place. The food pricing is way too expensive for iceberg salad, adequate garlic bread and mediocre wine. I ordered a chicken dish and had minestrone. They were both way too salty (a trick used by restaurants to hide poor quality or good-tasting food). And yes, the accordion player was awkward to say the least. \n\nOver-priced, overrated and a tourist trap with a miraculously good reputation. My advice? Go to Maggiano's for GREAT Italian food. Or Olive Garden. Or Buca di Beppo's even.  Just please, don't go here. Don't perpetuate the Battista's myth."
0,"nah. my friends did not like the poke/seafood salad...and i tasted it, it was not GOOD."
1,"Delicious, but expensive.\n\nDined here a few weeks ago and I just remembered right now how awesome the dinner rolls were. They looked sweet from the glaze on top, but there was salt sprinkled on top.\n\nCame here during Pacquiao-Cotto fight weekend so excitement was in the air at MGM. The restaurant was packed and everybody looked like they were having a good time.\n\nWith our party of 6, most of us ordered the surf and turf deal with respective sides. My gf and I got that along with the carrots and risotto.   Take note that the sides are HUGE and definitely family style. The filet mignon and shrimp was satisfying.\n\nAfter feasting, we ended the night with chocolate souffle and ridiculous sized serving of coffee. Each person got their own french press!\n\n6 people = $750. If you're looking for a lower priced steakhouse with a celebrity chef, I'd highly recommend StripSteak by Michael Mina at Mandalay."
1,"Used to be my go-to chinese place when I lived in AJ and I visited there last night after being gone 3 years and glad to say the food is still great. Love their honey walnut chicken (but I did notice the sauce was a bit different, not quite as sweet as it was but still good.) Service is always good, but when the blue hairs come in during the fall it gets very busy so expect service to be slow. Great value and yummy food! =)"
0,"Was excited to try this place for awhile out but was thoroughly disappointed, I think it all stemmed from the hair baked into my pupusa and our water that tasted faintly like horchata. Or maybe it was the waitresses hand in our salsa.  I have had good pupusas and these were pretty bad."
1,"Well, dont let the name fool you.............. this was a nice surprise . The food quite good, the onion rings were pretty damn good, served cold would have \""ROCKED\"" if served hot~\n   The place has a fun feel to it with the drawings & pick up lines on the walls .\n   The only issue were girl taking our order & serving the food. Both had issues keeping the orders straight... They were not busy and our orders still were not right however it was just a matter of getting the right food with the right sides on the right plates...... this would not put me off on returning. The girl who took our order was helpful on explaining the menu. The next time we are in the area we would come back if in the mood for a dog or wings."

We have both practiced yoga for a while now.\n\nSince then, I will not got back due to poor customer response.  I will not recommend this place to any of my friends."
0,"We finally tried the talked about Brunch at the Grand Concourse. Going in with high expectations, we left very underwhelmed. Not only are the food stations scattered around the dining room, but the food options themselves are lacking. \n\nThe 'hot station' has what I would call your typical breakfast buffet (eggs, bacon, sausage, etc.). There's a carving station with prime-rib, ham and turkey - the high point of the meal.\n\nSalad option were mushy, and the Bananas Foster was a quickly thrown together imitation, though the donut station was unique.\n\nMy made-to-order Bloody Mary was good, though.\n\n3 cocktails and two brunches for $75 -- I was expecting much, much more."
1,"The menu isn't large,  but the food is very tasty!  I haven't tasted any of the beers but I hear they are great.  Wait staff are always timely and attentive."
1,"Awesome beer selection and great burgers.  World famous?!?  Well, that's a bit of a stretch.  I think there are other burgers here in Phoenix that are just as good.  I'm not saying I've come across one that's much better, but definitely on the same level as this.  That being said, if you're looking for an amazing burger joint, this is one of them.  Pair it up with the awesome beer selection and that's what makes this place a cut above the rest.  It's a great location in a great neighborhood.  Prices are fairly reasonable but anytime you go above the $10 mark for a burger, it's a problem."
0,"I am a fan of Ikea for the most part and this review is less about the merchandise and more about the complete lack of service coupled with a massive amount of attitude. Tacky. I went with a good friend of mine to Ikea over Memorial Day weekend in hopes of getting a really great deal on a bed for her new apartment. A seemingly simple task one might think. Well, unbeknownst to us there was an elusive coupon needed at check out in order to purchase the bed/mattress combo. There was no signage posted and the sales associate upstairs (whose name escapes me) did not give us one. So, here we are, the store is closing and the sales girl, Randi,with an unbelievably abhorrent countenance, demands that we retrieve a coupon from upstairs and proceeds to laugh at my friend with a pompous smirk on her face. However, in the sales girl's supposed infinite knowledge and wisdom, she failed to realize that the store was closing, therefore THERE WAS NO ONE UPSTAIRS to give us this said coupon. Hoping there wasn't a storewide pandemic of awful dispositions, we looked to Randi's manager Todd for help. WRONG. The next gentleman (if you could call him that) was equally rude and condescending, claiming that \""there are signs posted everywhere telling you that you need a coupon...and maybe I can help you if I get the time.\"" We checked, and captain awful hair was, indeed, incorrect in his proclamation regarding the alleged \""signs.\"" At this point my friend is nearly in tears with frustration as we wanted to get out of there as much as they did. Then, captain early 90's pony tail looks and realizes his mistake. There is no flipping signage. He tried to apologize and be more accomodating by apathetically stating that \""oh they must have changed the signs.\""  We bypass the ridiculous coupon catastrophy only to be met with a flood of more aggravation.  My friend would like to pay with both card and cash. Apparently this is a near impossible task for the elite group of people that make up the Ikea employee squad.  At this point the quote un quote manager asks if I can put part of the total on my card as the tills have already been closed. Are you kidding me? This is so exceedingly tacky that I just stare at the poor girl blankly. Open up a register. There was a silver lining, however. Linda, who was the only in there with a brain, was walking by with a cash tray and rung us up. So we managed to pay the total and get out. Meanwhile, I have lost 45 minutes of my life that I can never get back because I have squandered it on completely unhelpful human beings. I just hope not all Ikeas are staffed with incompetent sales people full of attitude and self entitlement. We were not asking them to solve world hunger or the aids epedemic, we were simply after a little bit of compassion and professionalism."
1,I came here several times while visiting Montreal because it was so close to where I was staying at the McGil residence halls. The abundant seating and free WiFi made it a great place to sit and journal or write emails. Great mochas and scrumptious pastries/baked goods!
1,"Great place with best book prices.  Some of the books are not in the best condition but they are a fraction of the original price, all of them are.  It's amazing.  I'll go in there and spend and hour or two looking through different books.  \n\nThey've got everything I like there, photography, nature and some technology.  I also love stopping in there so I can grab those free bookmarks they have at the register.  Also have a cd, record and vintage book section there that is always fun to look at.  Of all the books I've bought there there were under $20."

1,"Best Vietnamese Food in Vegas. Spring rolls were on point just like their sister restaurant in Orange County, their seafood banh canh was flavorful, and their banh xeo was just up to par.\n\nStaff is friendly, restaurant is clean, and the owner is personable. \n\nI am so grateful now that I don't need to search for delicious Vietnamese food here in Vegas anymore!! \n\nAnd yes, it's located on Spring Mountain"

0,"I hate to do this, but this is the 2nd time I have ordered online, and almost an hour later they called and told me they 'just saw my faxed in order'  Uhm, sorry, I placed it online on YOUR WEBSITE.  If you can't accept/handle online orders that's fine, but don't pretend you can.  The first time they never 'saw' my order, and when I called in an hour later they told me they couldn't reverse the charges on my card.  So I had to get the Pita's still delivered, even though by the time we got them it was 2 hours after we initially ordered.  The delivery guy let it slip that they never put paper in their printer, so no online orders could print.  That's just crazy.  Also, the Pitas aren't as good as the old University location.  Sad, I guess no more Pita's for our office...  :-("
0,"Wow.. Where do I start...\n\nOk so I use this app ALL the time, and it has never once let me down, UNTIL NOW. Im born and raised from NY, needless to say, barbershops up there don't survive unless they give quality haircuts, there's just too much competition. I'm pretty picky when it comes to my hair. I lived in Raleigh for about 5 years before moving to charlotte, and I managed to find an amazing barber who cut hair better than anyone i had been to even in NY. Well now im in charlotte and in desperate need of a haircut so I search on yelp and choose this shop. \n\nLet me start off by saying I dont know if i got the wrong barber or what the case was but i dont know what the other people were thinking giving this place 5 stars. It gets one star for these reasons.\n\n1- 18 dollar haircut for ABSOLUTELY NO REASON. I got a 20 minute half*** cut, a \""hot towel shave\"" on the back of my neck only.... WHAT? REALLY? Dont get me wrong, im not cheap ive spent upwards of $30 on a cut when its warranted but this was just a joke. I had hair on my face, not once was it brushed off. When I was shown my haircut I expressed little emotion to see if the barber would notice that I wasn't pleased, nope, just prepped me for my \""hot towel shave\"". Even upon leaving I just got a measly, \""Thanks\"" and they knew I was a first time customer because I told them. Just terrible service. It was dead in there too when i went.\n\n2. I looked at the guy getting a haircut next to me. He was almost done, I looked at his hair, and my grandmother could have done a better job. Upon being asked \""what do you think?\"" The guy cringed with that sense of, \""Eh, I hate it\"", and proceeded to say \""Its fine\"". Barber didnt even bat an eyelash and prepped him for his \""hot towel shave\"".\n\n3.Overall the experience was awful, and I hate having to down a business, but I will never go back there, I would rather drive 2.5 hours back to Raleigh to get a quality haircut, where the barber makes sure you dont leave looking anything short of top notch, you get a real hot towel shave, and you walk out feeling like a million bucks not like ****. Also for the record, my main barber charges $20 per cut plus tip too. Price is not a big deal as long as it is worth it, and this place was not worth it.\n\nIf you have the stones to give this shop a shot, hopefully for the sake of the business i was one of very few customers that had that bad of an experience. Just giving you fellow yelpers my opinion."

0,"Excited to try the happy hour dishes, my husband and I were seated in the lounge.  We sat there for 20 minutes and didn't have anyone visit our table. We then moved to the bar where for 5 minutes, 3 bartenders helped everyone around us and we were ignored. Finally, I told my husband it was time to leave. He talked to the manager, but I was so disinterested at this point."
1,Love the staff and instructors! People are nice and don't laugh @ you if you are a first timer in a class!
1,"I've never played laser tag before attending my triplet nephews' 9th birthday party this weekend. What a blast!!\n\nThis place was packed to the gills on Sunday afternoon. Not only did they have one party after another, but there were lots of families who were simply walking in. Now, maybe they have a procedure for entry that was blind from my eyes, but I did not see any ticket taking happening here. It appears that you can probably just walk in and join up with a group. Weird!\n\nThe cost of 7.50 per 15 minute game seemed a little steep to me, but I guess if you sneak into another game it might be worth it. (Although I would never recommend such a thing!) Buy games in bulk to receive a discount. They have other specials, so call them for details.\n\nGAME TIPS: Get up as high as you can. People that are down below are easy targets. Capture the other teams bases for loads of extra points! Keep your gun down when you are not shooting. You can get tagged easily there.\n\nLUKE, LUKE, LUKE.. you brave gentleman. Luke was the facilitator to our birthday party and games. This guy is the epitome of cool. He has just enough sass, sarcasm, and patience to be the perfect host to these wild, maniacal children. I found him to be quite funny too!\n\nI am taking one star away because the second game we played had 36 players in it. WAY TOO MANY! We were simply falling all over each other and it made the game way less fun. TIP: I asked and apparently Tuesday nights are the least crowded. \n\nGet in this place now!"
0,"Ok has been 7 months since my 1 star rating.  I thought I'd stop in to buy a new camcorder.  BIG MISTAKE.  One guy working in the department while the store manager and other employees talked at the customer service counter about what they watched on TV last night.  After asking 3 times for the camera guy to request some help, I gave up after waiting 40+ minutes.  I have now sworn to never go back to this store.  I have no idea how they even stay in business."
1,This is a very unique bakery. A couple of times now I've received cupcakes as gifts of congratulations or thank you. I think they make a great gift especially if you don't know what to get someone! Everyone loves cupcakes! The baked goods are not what you may be used to. They are not going to taste sweet and processed with a lot of sugar. The ingredients taste fresh. I love the coconut! Mmmm! They also offer breakfast and lunch! A little hard to find and to park but worth it. Something different and fresh and delicious!
1,Fun place for dinner or happy hour. Really helpful waitress suggested beers we might like to try based on what we told get were our current favorites. Delicious food.
1,"Any time I go Las Vegas and want to stay on the Strip, Harrah's is the hotel I choose.  The location of Harrah's is excellent-right in the middle of the Strip. The rooms are nice, clean, comfortable and the price is very reasonable.  Harrah's is not too big, so you don't have to walk a mile to get out of the hotel. Around the hotel there are tons of places to eat inexpensively. For the room choice, I often ask for the one in Carnival Tower which is away from the noisy Carnival Court.  All deluxed rooms are renovated, so they are all good. I used to stay in Madi Gras Tower a few times, no problem with the noise either, but some said it's noisy. Anyway the rooms in Madi Gras Tower are a bit smaller then those in Carnival Tower. If you're not looking for a very luxurious hotel, just a hotel with good clean comfortable room and lively atmosphere, then I think you won't be disappointed with Harrah's."
0,"I do not know anything else that I can say, but tonight experience at this local restaurant was terrible.\n\nAs I pulled into the drive-thru I observed several people standing in front of the restaurant entrance, after waiting for several minutes no one came over the speaker to take my order. I pulled around to ask the employees if someone will take my order only to be laughed at... I again pulled around to look for a corporate telephone number to which I was unsuccessful.\n\nBottom line, don't waste your time if you are trying to get some food in the later part of the evening at this location. They have posted hours but refuse to take an order... Disgusting customer service"
1,It not often drive too this side of town but every year come Match Madness tradition meet some friends we drink and watch games all day. IF UNLV is in the tournament this is THE PLACE too be! It amazes me the past two years many Rebel fans come out support not just watch but vocal too. Lots of flat screens all around the bar in different sizes so watch any game on great spot. \n\nThe bar area not that big space so if its packed like aka Rebels game go early. The dining area is decent size area mostly table not many booths. The parking lot not problem in shopping mall so plenty too go around. \n\nThe food always been fan of their food especially the boneless wings and variety of sauces you can choose from my favorite is the mango sauce. Selection of draft beers is always good. It not no yard house but over 20 or more beers too choose from on tap. Something there you can enjoy.
1,"Vegas Computer Doctor ROCKS!  They fixed an iMac that, without a doubt, would have had to been 'junked' had it been taken to a dealer. Thank goodness I found Vegas Computer Doctor...Armando's patience and calm helped me get back a great machine...and avoid a lot of $$$.  They're trustworthy and reliable."
1,"The 5 stars is based on their sashimi. The fish practically melts in your mouth. It's so fresh with none of the icky oily feel from most of the other places I've been to. The best thing is their fresh wasabi, which tastes so much better than the usual green glob served. The downside is of course that sashimi is quite expensive.\n\nTheir sushi rolls, while creative and decently sized, weren't all that unique. Keep in mind practically all sushi rolls taste similar to me so I won't let that affect my rating."
0,"The food here is great, but the service is TERRIBLE.  I have been there twice, and the first time I figured the poor and rude service was a fluke so I didn't write a review.  Well, we gave it another try and again...TERRIBLE service.  The waiter acted like we were bothering him, and walked away before we even finished talking.  We waited 15 minutes for our table, which I wouldn't have minded, but the hostess said they had a table almost ready for us when we walked in.  It took forever to get our bill (hand scratched on a notepad), and we were overcharged for our drinks.  Happy hour prices are awesome and I really do like the food, but because of the poor/lazy/rude attitudes of the wait staff I will not be coming back.  The bus boys were very on top of things, but without a better trained wait staff I don't see why people would come back.  Check out Firefly on the same block for even better food and fantastic service :)"
0,"While coffee is decent as Starbucks can be. The help has attitude. The place was burning up hot inside and when I asked if they had a/c I was told rudely by the barista \"" I burn up every shift. \""  putting a much more sour taste than the coffee in my mouth ."
1,"I have some mixed feelings about this place.\n\nTo be positive, let's start with the pro's: it is generally nice and provides a touch of Vegas without the long drive there.  The hotel room that I stayed in was modern and had a touch of class as well.  I didn't really gamble but there was a decent selection of machines.  The food is also pretty good for a holiday party.  A variety of cheese platters (with my favorite Kalamata olives!!!), and the Filet Mignon and Salmon were tasty.\n\nAs for the con's, the gambling floor absolutely reeks of cigarette smoke.  If you come here, do so with the expectation and intention of constantly inhaling second-hand smoke.  The pillows (all 5-7 of them) are also very round.  So, if you are like me and are used to a flat pillow, bring your own unless you don't want to sleep well.  The soft drinks are also hideously priced.  The bartender cracked open a can, poured it, and then charged $3.50.  I'm sorry, but this is not the Bellagio!!! \n\nOverall, again, it is a decent experience if you want to go to Vegas for a day without leaving PHX!"
1,Delicious food. I usually get the chicken  tikka masala with plain naan. Clean and casual. Small  quaint place to eat. Friendly staff. Good service.
0,"I don't know if it is the quality of the gel polish brands they're using, but I've been getting gel done on my nails for well over 5 years and I've never had a worse experience. The application was sloppy, the blue gel never set right (felt like silicone rather than the usual hard finish). It chipped and peeled the very first day - that's never happened to me before.\n\nI returned the next day and they reapplied with a different brand, this time the pink took two days to chip up. I genuinely felt bad because the nail tech tried so hard, but they clearly have some subpar products."
0,"This is not a zoo. This place had one or two interesting exhibits, but it was mostly goats and peacocks. There was a fish exhibit in the back where the number of dead fish significantly outweighed the number of living fish. I would definitely NOT recommend this \""park\"" to anyone- and their website is very misleading."
1,"I had been going to LA Fitness for a couple years. I also coach high school sports and run some of the training, so I thought I had a good grasp on fitness. The problem was that at LA Fitness I was temped to do only the things I wanted to do... basketball, elliptical machine, and a few other things that I felt good about, but honestly I had almost no results. \n\nMy friend suggested North Scottsdale Crossfit. The diversity of the exercises and how quick the workouts were really appealed to me. \n\nKevin, the instructor, introduced me to the correct form and encourages intensity but  nothing crazy. After you get going there is a fun environment of encouragement and competition, mainly with yourself to beat your previous marks. \n\nFor those who already know about Crossfit, you will find an authentic Crossfit experience, not a cardio-class that occasionally incorporates the Crossfit approach.  \n\nI highly recommend North Scottsdale Crossift."
1,"Been here a few times and I have to day something. Such care is put into the dishes that's it's hard to ignore. One could say that a pancake is easy to perfect, but that's not true. When a restaurant pays attention to perfect execution of a simple dish, that deserves recognition.\n\nI've eaten several dishes here and most recently had the chilequile. I've never been disappointed with the food or the warmth of the staff. Kudos for bringing such a great little eatery to my downtown neighborhood."
1,"Great hotel with excellent staff. Clean, easy to locate, great location, comfortable bed, nice shower and adequate pool.\nNegative: there are no drawers in the room. Literally, no drawers. There are some shelves in the bathroom, but there is not a single drawer in the whole room. \nWe had a 3 month old infant when we stayed here for 4 days and the drawers would have helped. However, not a huge issue.\nI read some reviews that were annoyed with the air conditioner. I am a REALLY light sleeper and I had no issues with the air conditioner. \nAlso, rooms on the west side are nicer because you get a sunset view of Tempe Town Lake."
0,"As someone who manages a bar, I generally keep an open mind going into a new place. That was quickly closed when the owner of the bar came absolutely unglued, using obscene language and profanities towards our group. After her tirade of foul language and threatening gestures she then told us to leave or she'd have us arrested. Mind you this is the woman who was threatening physical violence against us not 10 minutes before. If you'd like to be treated as a CUSTOMER, and not a whipping pole, I'd suggest ANY other bar. If you'd like to be treated like absolute garbage by a raging alcoholic, head on in.  The bar tenders were ok, but clearly not fast paced enough to handle our group of 12."
0,"Wow, what a bad experience.   We ate here back in July and loved it.   This time it was totally different.   Flies filled the restaurant, the taco meat was fatty and the salads were wilted.   Luckily the manager, Daniel, dropped the bill, but they need to make some changes."
0,My husband and a few of his close friends tried this place for lunch one day and had a great lunch! He was so pleased with his experience he wanted to take me there for dinner. We started with calamari which was so greasy we could hardly eat it. The pieces were literally dripping with grease. \nFor main course I ordered the special of the day which was seared ahi tuna. It was charred and totally cooked thru. It was more like a tough steak than a piece of fish. I sent it back and ordered the salmon instead. The salmon was burned as well and so salty it was inedible. \nNeedless to say we left and had to eat elsewhere. \nThe bright light is the service. Friendly and attentive! The staff made an awful dining experience somewhat tolerable. \nNeedless to say I won't be dining again here unless things really change in the kitchen!
1,"Nice to hear a GOOD tale about a business...Month back I bought a fruitless Plum tree at Star Nursery...It croaked in just a few days...Went back and showed them pixs and whithout a hassle they said to come back and they would exchange it for a different tree that might do better in our back yard...Jim was the mgr. and today he brought out two trees from the back of their lot to show me...Above and beyond...That is why I shop at STAR Nursery...You should , too...If you hit the Ann Rd store, thank Jim once again for me...OK?"
1,"Went here on Saturday night, 9:00pm, 11/16/13.  As I was in-town on business, I was alone.  There was plenty of parking for my double-cab, 8' bed, full sized truck.  Walked right in and had a table in 3 minutes.  Ambience is slightly upscale.  The men were dressed like you'd expect in the main dining room of a cruise ship.  The waitresses looked matronly, primarily because of their matronly uniform.  I guess the costume is some sort of a maid's uniform, which included a white cap.  I did not laugh to myself because they, and the rest of the establishment was indeed fairly classy.  No teenagers worked here. \n\n I had a salad, med-rare prime rib, creamed corn, spinach, and  Yorkshire pudding.  Yorkshire pudding is a special bread that you dip your remaining au-juice and other juices off your plate with.  The salad came with a house dressing that seemed to be a mixture of catalina/tomato and french.   The dressing was light and not very thick at all.  The waiter did NOT ask me what kind of dressing I want, so that might be all there was.  but it was sooooo good!  The dinner also  came with sourdough bread and butter.  Don't let the name \""creamed corn\"" turn you off.  It's not the stuff you pour out of a can at home.  It really is very good.  Although the prim rib itself is very, very good, it really is no better than places such as The Outback and Texas Roadhouse.  So go for the ambience, or spinach, creamed corn.  If not, go somewhere cheaper.   \n\nBecause of the ambience, creamed corn and spinach, I will be back!  (For sure.)"
1,Best car wash in town they actually wash your car by hand quick and easy very very Clean but wait they also wax car too customer service is very nice my car was so dirty now it's very clean are usually wash my car once a month but I will be returning here-because of the quality work they do also there's a nice lounge thank you can sit and wait for your car and they have a big glass window for you can watch your car being wash
0,"Wow. This place really angers me. First of all, they screw up my order every time. Blended Cinnamon Chai Latte. Either they forget the cinnamon or forget to blend it. EVERY TIME. The last time I was in there the owner gave me a dirty look and I have no idea why! I'm always polite especially to people handling my food or drink. Dare I say because I'm of an ethnic minority. Maybe I'm going too far, but I have no clue why that woman gives me the look of death every time I come in. I go in today and ask for a gift card.. They're out. Really? IT'S FRIGGGIN CHRISTMAS. Fine, you're out. Will you restock? Yes, after Christmas. Wow. I really just dislike this place so much and going back today made me realize why I stopped in the first place. I've ordered tea from this place multiple times and they all taste the same. Do they think I'm an idiot? I have these flavors of tea from THEIR shop at  home and some how my tangerine green tea tastes just like the black tea when I have them make it. UGH. Never again."
0,"Wow where to start...\nIf you decide to give this place a try based on their \""good\"" ratings and reviews you're better off looking elsewhere.\nMe and my girlfriend were looking for ordinary tacos and when we noticed the awesome ratings and good reviews this place had achieved, we thought it would be at least decent.\nWhen we got there and ordered our drinks, I ordered the horchata because according to people on Yelp, they had the best one could taste.\nAs soon as I got mine, I noticed it had some kind of canned fruit on top, if had some sort of strawberry syrup and to top it off, it had a brownish color instead of the usual white.\nWhen I tried it, it was so sweet that one sip is all I could take before I decided to tell the waiter to take it back because I was not going to pay for that.\nMy girlfriend's Jamaica also had a purple color to it and she told me it tasted like grape Kool-aid.\nWhen we were attempting to order food, all I wanted from the start was a few simple tacos...\nTheir tacos were $2.97 each!!!  That is absolute madness!!!\nFor the size of the tortilla and the quality of the taco, the MOST those could have been worth anywhere else was $1.25.\nWhen everything was going bad and our night had been ruined, me and my girlfriend started looking around and we noticed that only white people were eating there.\nThen everything made sense; white people don't know REAL mexican food, so they assume this crap quality was the \""best they had ever tasted\"" and thus very good review on yelp came from white people.\nIf you know what real mexican food tastes like and are looking for just simple tacos, DO NOT GO TO THIS UTTERLY AMERICANIZED MEXICAN JOINT!!!!\nYou will be sorely disappointed.\nANY cheap taco stand in Mexico can beat the taste of these so called \""street tacos\"" AND FOR A THIRD OF THE PRICE!!!\nIf I could I would give this place 0 stars."
1,"Hibachi is normally related to Japanese name. however, I notice all the Asian worker speak Northern CHINESE. \n\nThe place is very  clean - as expected - it is a new.\n\nthe food: good selection, good salad bar, very reasonable price, fresh. it taste approximately equal to other Asian buffet. All good."
1,"What a welcome addition to the neighborhood full of yummy food choices!  There are so many options, each burger is as original as you!   If you are up to the challenge, may I suggest their 20oz burger!   With a mountain of fresh toppings, each bite is a new experience!  If you finish it and the fries......you become a legend on their wall of fame.  Over 50 ingredients to create the perfect shake, you just can't go wrong here!    Bring an appetite and perhaps a bib, you won't be disappointed!"
1,"Wow what a hidden gem this place is!!! Stopped in with my mom and sister. I ordered a bean tostada, pastor street taco and some chips and salsa. Everything tasted fresh and amazing. Beans were creamy, salsa was a fresh pico de gallo, chips were crispy, and the pastor was succulent and a little hint of spice. My mom ordered the steak fajitas and they were well worth the wait. The meat was tender and flavorful and the onions and peppers were caramelized and perfectly seasoned. The rice had such a great texture and hint of flavor that I loved. My sister had a veggie street taco which I had a bite of and it was surprisingly good. It was beans, peppers, onions, potatoes and avocado. The only negative was the ladies bathroom was in disrepair and a little dirty. However the food and quick service was outstanding. I will definitely be back."
0,"Sigh...I was really excited to have found another Shanghai style restaurant, but I was deeply disappointed. Food was terrible. Panda Express tasted better than this. I can't believe the owners had the courage to get in the restaurant business with skills this poor. I can't recommend. Don't waste your money here."
0,The office staff is rude and unprofessional.\n\nI will be taking my kids elsewhere.
1,I'm from Chicago and I felt like I'd stepped into a place back home. The lentil soup was delicious. Nicest people too and inside was well maintained.
1,Anyone know why they shut down?  I'm totally bummed!
0,Not very good service. Orders came out wrong. Waited a long time for a glass for my beer.  Waited too long for ketchup. Mistakes on check.
1,Fresh ingredients as far as produce is a must (I don't eat beef or pork) so this joint nailed it for quality greens and spices. Wines were a tad pricy but quality nonetheless.
1,"Surprisingly good. I had my doubts since it seemed overpriced from a glance at the menu, but it was quite good. I had their chicken francese, which is nothing like the typical francese sauce one might expect (creamy, with artichoke hearts and mushrooms). My boyfriend had the lasagna and enjoyed that as well. The atmosphere is very nice and the service is fairly good. They are especially attentive with the water for some reason! We could see parts of the fish tank outside from where we sat in the back...a nice view. Overall, a great experience. Expect to pay $15-$25 for your entree, however."
1,"Years ago, my friend Jen raved about the steamed bagel sandwiches that she'd eaten while attending school in Ohio.  She couldn't contain her excitement about Bagel & Deli coming to Charlotte, and right down the road from her house no less!  I'll admit that I was somewhat dubious about the idea of something tasty coming from Ohio, and the idea of steaming a bagel just seemed strange and inappropriate, like eating chili on spaghetti noodles.  Steamed bread?  I cringed at the thought of the microwave sandwiches I ate in elementary school.  Boy, was I wrong.  Steamed bagels ARE good.  I like them, I like them, Sam I Am.  \n\nIf you're heading to Owens for the first time, prepare yourself for being overwhelmed by the menu options.  You're going to go all deer-in-the-headlights and stuff.  Not only is the printed menu extensive, but there are construction paper signs hanging on a line displaying some of their more creatively titled menu items; hung there to distract you and cause you to inexplicably stare for minutes on end.   There is a seemingly endless list of fantastic sandwiches for you to choose from, or you can create and name your very own bagel sandwich creation.  \n\nI've only had one sub-par experience here but it was during a weird time of day when I'd imagine the third stringers were in the game.  I think that the vast majority of people are like me and enjoy eating at Owens after a long night out with friends, but this is a great place for breakfast or lunch any old day."
1,"While visiting Vegas this week, we were desperate for a good wood-fired style pizza and yelp reviewers helped us out and came through with accurate descriptions and were right-on with quality.  Needless to say, coal-fired pizza is now our new favorite.\n\nInitially we drove from the strip out to S. Rampart to get away from the congestion.  To our dismay, they said they had to clean the ovens (before the dinner rush hour) and we walked out totally disappointed.  Not 30 seconds later, waiter Moe, comes running out and says they can hold off with cleaning after our pizza.  Nowhere else would I have ever experienced someone who really understood and cared enough to do that.  Anyone else would have shrugged their shoulders and said \""oh well\"". \n\nWe ordered the roma tomato, fresh mozarella, and basil pizza.  Any other Margherita type pizzas are scarce with all their ingredients, but not this one.  I couldn't believe how it was made with the eater in mind.  A bite of everything in every bite.  No skimping on their end.  We also ordered the caprese salad for an appetizer and it was outstanding, in flavor, presentation and portion size.  The moz they import from NY is so fresh and tender.  \n\nWe will definitely be back on our next visit to LV. \n\nNow we go back to VA where I have to drive 45 minutes for our second favorite pizza, wood-fired grilled. \n\nThanks Grimaldi's on S Rampart and thanks Yelp reviewers of all the Grimaldi locations for leading us to a great find!\n\nNQ"
1,"This place offers great happy hour discounts and the rolls, as the other reviews state, are fresh, well made and most importantly delicious! I know some people like to go for the 'cheapest' most basic rolls for sushi like spicy tuna/california, but I would highly recommend their specialty rolls (What the Heck is my fav) as they are really creative/unique, and very, very tasty. It's definitely worth stopping by if you are close by if you are a fan of good sushi. Fantastic customer service too!"
1,"Beautiful breakfast this morning! Everything is so fresh and tempting. In the end, I went for the Bircher muesli and was not disappointed. The coffee is of a good standard as well...something I find hard to come by, having lived away from Melbourne for a year now.\nI am planning to go back for lunch at some stage during my Edinburgh visit. The sandwiches looked amazing!"
0,"We thought it was a joke when my Banana Foster French Toast was covered with a film of brown slime coming out from the mouth of the possessed girl from \""Exorcist.\"" After a few stirs, the revolting concoction would coagulate into an amorphous blob metastasizing and multiplying to devour its prey in a science horror film. \n\nPanicky and nauseous, we summoned our young waitress to attend to our distress. \""This is the banana foster sauce. It is not supposed to be syrupy and this is how it's always been made like this,\"" she answered with such composure and disinterest in our seemingly futile concern. \n\nCuriosity dared us to ask how the sauce was made. Returned with the precarious object still on the plate, our waitress proclaimed it was cooked with butter, reduced sugar, triple sac [and cornstarch, alien DNA...].\n\nLightning struck us as we exited the restaurant in trepidation into the scorching 109 degree heat under the Phoenix sun: we were in Tempe, Arizona."
0,"Getting Run Down and Smells!   Have gone to this 131 Main since it opened and have loved it for years.  As with any restaurant, hotel or business, at some point things need to be renovated.   Time to put some of all that money we spent back into the freshening up the restaurant.   It smells and tables, seats and restaurant in general showing its age.   The table we sat at last month was pealing all over the top and was  scratched up.   VERY DARK LIGHTING CAN'T COVER IT UP ANY LONGER!   I was embarrassed as we brought 2 couples who commented on it.    Also, with changes in management we had the worst service (first time we had bad service there in 8 years) we've ever had.   \n\nGet your act together 131 Main!  Don't rest on past success and renovate for the future!!!"
0,"I love and respect Mayor Goodman, but when it comes to a steak, we can all do better. \n\nI only heard one good review, and it was from this guy named David Sadjak, who lives by the motto; \""A free meal always tastes better\"".\n\nHe loves Bucca Di Pepo, and every second rate buffet in town, that gives him free or half priced food, and in his case, someone else was buying.\n\nI had to see for myself. I can only sum it up one way;\n\nOn Anthony Bourdain's programs, he always tastes the food and then raves how good it is. If he has nothing good to say, he just doesn't say it. He talked with Mayor Goodman about the \""old days\"" of Las Vegas, and did not say one thing about the food.\n\nSince I can't say anything nice, out of respect to Mayor Goodman, and his service to the City, I will simply not say anything."
1,"Nice middle-eastern place near CMU.\nI usually get the 'Vegetarian Special' which is box with rice, hummus and baba ganoush (and bread). They also have awesome 'Sleek' which is this awesome concoction of kale, onions and beans.. tried it for the first time today and loved it.\nThe owner seems to really care about his food... always reminds me to hold box the right way when I get take-out.. seems like he really knows his middle-eastern food.\nAwesome place, but a bit on the pricier end, I could get a more diverse platter of food for cheaper at the middle-eastern truck at margaret morrison st."
0,"This is certainly not the 'best' kebab house I've been to, nor will it probably be the best that anyone's been to.  There's nothing really wrong with the service, it's friendly enough and they serve the food pretty quickly.  The problem is the food.  The kebabs in most takeaways look quite greasy and fatty, but these are in a whole other coronary leage altogether.  The donner meat which I tasted was salty and fatty, the salad wasn't too fresh and the chips weren't great either.  It was quite cheap, costing only about \u00a33, but even this was steep considering the poor quality.  \nMaybe I came at a bad time for them, but when there are so many decent takeaways in the area it's unlikely that I'll be back."
0,"Worst experience with a hairdresser ever, at this location. Made an appointment with Diane for a body wave. When I was sort of greeted by her she looked at my hair and said \""You get body waves?\"" Yeah, that's why I booked one at your salon. Then she argued with me about when to trim, I wanted after she wanted before, and after five minutes acknowledged that it didn't matter, but FIRST telling me the perm \""wouldn't soak in\"" on the ends unless she trimmed it. Then she argued with me about the rods. It's taken me over ten years to figure out with Aveda perm hairstylists what the perfect combo is. Diane knew better, but finally agreed. Then she proceeded to comb my wet hair, from the forehead back, scratching my scalp and jerking my head. That wasn't enough, though. She then started rolling it with the rods she thought I should have.  I got up and left. When I addressed the problem at the front, NO EFFORT WAS MADE TO HELP me other than to offer coming back and talking to the owner. Yeah. Right. THAT'S gonna happen. Horrible salon...dirty, also, just as a side note."
1,"Really good breakfast.  Not sure why it has some bad reviews from people, because the 2 dishes my wife and I got were really good.  I had the banana french toast (will order with extra syrup on the side next time) and the meatloaf hash with eggs.  Both were good and huge.  We also got an orange crush champagne spritzer, which was good despite the fact that it sounds strange.  I would also try the bloody mary's next time since it looked like they made their own mix and everybody was ordering them."
0,"This place was good until it was well known in the asian community. You have to fight for a parking spot. It's waay crowded, the employees have somewhat of a lack of communication.\n\nThe positives of this place, it reminds me of home...the palenke (however you spell it) smell. The fish you can inspect yourself for freshness (I am picky when it comes to fish). Also I like the fact they can clean and cook it for you (for those who are always on the run)."
1,"Wow, this particular location is situated on a busy street and yet nobody has done a review? Ok so here's mine. When it comes to fast food taco joints the two names that come to mind are Taco Bell and Del Taco. Im telling you right now, I am never gonna do a review for Taco Bell unless I am blown away by some memorable event foodwise. \n\nDel Taco has better choices, specials, and heck, you can even order a burger off their menu if you're bored with tacos or just wanna change it up a bit. That's pretty bold I think and I do admit that their bacon double del cheeseburger is pretty good. \n\nA lot of people tend to go here on tuesday nights for dinner. Why? Because tuesdays are taco nights! This is what a lot of college going students live for! A lot of good food for not a lot of money! Most places have 2 tacos for 99 cents or 3 for 1.29! You can choose either hard or soft tacos. I think the most tacos I ever ordered were 40! I had a grip of people up in my house and I only paid around 20 bucks for a boat load of tacos! Hell yeah!\n\nJust about everything on their menu is the bomb! I have yet to begun to scratch the surface! Also I dont ever remember getting any bad service from these guys whether its this location or another. Most locations are 24 hours so for you peeps that get the munchies at 2 in the morning for some reason or another (you know who you are!), then you are definitely covered!\n\nSo for more info on their menu, go to: www.deltaco.com"
1,"This space has been many bars over the years, but the Knuckle Down Saloon seems to really be working here.  The location is a little hard to find, but you won't find nicer barstaff anywhere.  Drinks are good, even better if you catch a happy hour!  Weekends bring regular blues bands and jam sessions, which are becoming very popular.  There's also a great karaoke show on Wednesdays, hosted by Doc.\n\nThe Knuckle Down is our favorite bar for post-volleyball refreshment."
1,I had a delious chicken filly deluxe sub. Everything is freshly made. The chicken is grilled and very tender and not dried out.
1,"The right formula!  Gourmet Food, No, but good food served in a very clean setting by thorougly friendly staff, and all at value-oriented pricing.  We love Gourmet Foodm but are also regular fans of IHOP!"
1,There ain't no great Mexican restaurants here in Scottsdale at all.  Too many chain restaurants here.  But a friend told me about this place so I gave it a try.  Man one the best places I've been to in Scottsdale.  I would recommend any one who live in Scottsdale to try out this place.
1,"I personally love this bakery but it is too far away!!  From bakery to bakery you will find that the sugar content changes even when comparing what you think are \""like\"" products. For instance, a cream puff, if you are at a french bakery the cream puff may look the same but they generally go lighter on the sugar ingredient so you may even be able to detect a slight egg taste in the pastry, Jewish bakeries and Mexican bakeries also tend to go lighter on the sugar so although it is a tasy treat I often walk away thinking it was good but I have had better. Great Buns bakes the way I like it. The Cream Puffs a light and fluffy and sweet like I believe a dessert should be. Not sugary, mind you, just sweet and delicious. Obviously there are bakeries that have slightly changed their recipes to meet the American sweet tooth market and this is one of those bakeries.\n\nAs an extra bonus, if you call them and tell them you are looking for a certain treat such as a Napolean, if they don't have them available that day they will try to accomodate your request by making them the following day or day after.  They have always been wonderful about trying to fill your sweet tooth cravings for you.  BTW Napoleans are very hard to find around town and theirs are to die for!!  Call ahead and make sure you arrive on a day they have Napoleans available. You will not be disappointed... :)"
0,"Atmosphere =F\nWait Staff and Greeter Girl=D\nBus boy/chip boy=A+\n\nI went to dinner with  my kids tonight and the girl who sat us couldn't even smile just a little...she almost seemed annoyed that we walked in the front door.  We were seated and weren't acknowledged for a good 6 o 7 minutes.  The bus boy saw this and immediately brought chips...still no waiter.  After my son tried the hot salsa he was gasping and turning red dying for some water that the bus boy came over and took our drink order and gave us a menu\nThe waiter came over 2 seconds after that and asked if we were ready to order...we only had the menu for 2 to 3 seconds so no we weren't ready to order.  He said he come back....we waited for him to come back for over 10 minutes.  By the way, there was only 5 other tables being sat at...the restaurant was empty.  Our waiter NEVER smiled...seemed grumpy that he was working.  \n\nDid I tell you the bus boy/chip boy was great!!!  If it wasn't for him I would have left 1 star!  The food was just OK.  My sons got chicken tenders and fries and it tasted like the fryer hadn't been cleaned in weeks...UGH...soggy flat fries and the tenders turned a dark brown color from dirty fryer oil.\n\nNeedless to say I won't be coming back.  Hope the owner looks at these reviews and does something positive....the restaurant needs some spunk/life to it.  Just very drab and plain like the wait staff!"
1,"Been here dozen times. Food is amazing. Recommend filet quesadilla as I get it everytime. The flatbreads are also very good. The view is what most people come for. The one downside is service which you will see people complain about on here. Not bad on calm nights but weekends you can tell they dont have enough staff. I believe if they advertised to scottsdale and got more steady flow of people they would hire more people, but in mean time service will be iffy."
1,"Atlantic's FBO is great if you have some time to kill before your flight. There are a few large conference/computer rooms as well as private areas and a \""Fuel Cafe\"" on-site that makes horrible oatmeal, but decent paninis and excellent fries."
0,"i can not write a review without clicking on a 'star'- this veterenary place does not deserve any star at all!  \n\nworse service ever, staff are impolite, theres this asian front desk/back office staff that is rude and dreadful- she thinks she's all that! shes got the i dont care attitude!\n\nand dont even get me started with the so called vet doctors, we waited for almost an hour in room 4  to wait for that vet to see us!\n\nwhere is/are the owners of this dump???   clearly we can see that customer service is not priority! \nhey if you want to do good business- shame up or ship out!\n\narrogance is the word! this place deserve no star!!!\n\ndo us all a favor! close down your business!!! now!!!!!!!!!!"
0,"Scary.  Not run for your life scary, but creepy scary.  I think this is where dignity comes to die. Icky people on stripper poles.  Icky people grinding on the dance floor.  Icky people doing things that should be done In Private on/under tables near the dance floor.\n\nAdded one star because the bartender was nice and the drinks came quickly.  Otherwise, ick."
0,I am all about service and the gentleman that helped me tonight needs a course in customer service. I walked in to make an order and he made me feel as though I was inconveniencing him! In fact he kept throwing kitchen supplies in the back and when he hung up the phone with a customer before me he slammed the phone down. Even more alarming was after I have him my order he threw the pen I used at the register. I get we all have bad days and it looks like he was short staffed-- didn't see anyone else in the back- but geez cool your jets in front of customers. \nService aside the pizza is decent and I love the Howie Maui.
1,I use Glendale Sports for personal training and I must say Eagle is the best personal trainer in The West Valley his program is extremely effctive and customized to my exact needs. If you are looking for a professional and results... this place is a must.
1,"This place has the best fries, bar none. Order that and some tzatziki as a dip and you're in for a treat! I also took a Gyro pita and black cherry cola and this lunch REALLY hit the spot.\n\nI recommend to try this place at least once.\n\nService was good and the price tag was very good."
0,"This restaurant has a great decor and vibe and definitely ample outdoor space. Their food tastes great and the beer was cold with good service.\n\nI had the shrimp and crab stuffed greenpeppers. The shrimps were the size of my thumbnails. Since there was no lights at our table, I couldn't see the crab meat to confirm there was any crabmeat present. I certainly couldn't taste any crabmeat. My wife had a shrimp fajita which would be a children's version at Chili's if Chili's had such a dish.\n\nBottom line, my wife and I walked away hungry after spending $53 for dinner."
0,"Yesterday, we stop in for a late lunch. We decide to split a couple appetizers. While we are waiting they brought us the normal chips and salsa. The chips tasted stale and the salsa was pretty gross too. Then our food came. We ordered loaded nachos - which were far from loaded. I am still trying to figure out how they managed to put everything in one tiny corner of the plate. The second plate was the mini chimis. Oh my gosh, they were even worse! Soggy, covered in sour cream and what I think was guacamole?  They were inedible! Yuck! I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. No no no"
1,It was an ok price for the food. The food has a good taste. I ordered the Chicken Wings and it was soooo gooooooood. If you check in you get a free egg roll. I gave this place a 4 star because they gave me a veggie egg roll.
0,"Why even bother checking in online?  It went from 5 mins to 15 min wait so I checked in and headed over. 10 minutes later when I got there, they told me it was going to be another 20 minutes and I was at the bottom of the list.\n\nChecked in another day because it said 1 minute wait. I checked in and headed over. Was there about a minute later and it was packed. I was fourth on the list, and when I checked again it still shows a one minute wait time and there are six people on the list. \n\nWhen will I learn?"
1,"The food is always hot and made fresh. I prefer the atomic or hot boneless wings with ranch. This may sound odd but their ranch is really good too lol The boss there is really nice and friendly. He is the one that makes the tea everyday too...which reminds me a lot of southern sweet tea, which I have with lemon. They have a lot of soda to choose from as well. The place has a family style atmosphere so I would recommend this place to all my friends and co workers."
1,Awesome atmosphere and great paninis. Price was reasonable too!
0,"You get what you pay for. It's cheap and it looks cheap. \n\nMy friends and I headed to Vegas on a whim and nothing was planned, so we needed a room and fast. We called multiple places that were either booked or too expensive, so we finally checked in here.\n\nThe beds aren't comfortable and there really isn't anything special about this place, but it's a good choice if you are in Vegas to party and aren't planning on being in the room much.\n\nIt's not directly on The Strip but it's not far from it. We walked and it took us maybe 15-20 min."
1,"Another great hidden restaurant in the college corridor. You know you're in for some cheap eats when there's a place around the college. The food here is really good and seasoned just right. Everyone is friendly and treat you like family (good side of the family, not the cousin in prison side). I highly recommend coming here, shrimp burrito, super chicken burrito, carne asada taco, potatoe taco, fish taco, chicken nachos, and fish n chips washed down with deep fried Oreos. Everyone here all thumbs up from the crew. Highly recommend!!"
0,"Took my two year old here the other day and was charged $6 for her to paint and was also charged half the adult fee because \""I helped her\"".  She's two.  This should have been discussed up front. My wife was going to bring our daughter back next week but we won't be coming back if this is how the business is run.  What a shame."
0,"It's very unfortunate that Geoff is still trying to cover up for his company's error. It is true that our water timer was changed out but I made him aware of the change BEFORE he started doing all the plantings. If he was so on top of business, why didn't he realize the plants were dying and look at the water timer to see if that was the culprit? It took him months to figure out that our water timer was set incorrectly? Please. That's pathetic. If he is really a professional landscaper who cares about his work, he should have caught it before it was too late.\n\nAs for offering to replace the plants, we agreed to split the loss, not the cost. He said he would replace some of the plants, not all, for his part. He did not do so. Also, he never planted any of the Katie Ruella. These were supposed to be planted between the driveway and walkway. That never happened. I can't verify whether he did or did not plant the vine in the front of the house or the vine along the back wall since there was nothing there when we came out months later. If they died, they also mysteriously disappeared. The one cactus that he didn't plant is not the one I am complaining about. He never bought it and we never paid for it. No loss there.\n\nI am hardly trying to soil his company's name or reputation. He did that all by himself."
0,These guys are woman hating misogynists who named their bar after a Jack Black movie. That should say it all.
1,"Their pistachio frappe is soooo delish! But because I went around 7pm, not a lot of desserts to choose....wish there was a Henderson location so that I could go all the time!"
0,"We went in there on Sunday for lunch, it was packed-well the foyer was at least. After sitting there for ten minutes we were led to a dinig area that was maybe 1/3 full of customers. I was a bit confused on their use of host and hostesess. There was one person taking names, another checking the names, two other standing their alternating taking the diners to their seats in the dated dining room. Christ the only reason we went to this place is because we had a gift card and I'm hoping the gift giver next year makes a better choice. So my wife ordered the fettucini alfredo with Chicken (she has a standard) and I ordered some sort of entre that appeals to men that only eat beef, toss it with some pasta and voila, Dinner!  The humorous moment was when the server asked me how I would like my braised beef done-it's braised, look it up. Anyhow the sauce with it was a cream base, had some portabella mushrooms with it and some fresh parsley (to make it appear fresh) though my entre looked like it has been sitting under the hot lights for a good 10 minutes. The salad we got was marginal (I don't get what the big deal is) and the breadsticks seemed like they'd been sitting in the basket for 10 minutes (not so hot)- While our food  wasn't absolutely horrible, I don't understand why this place is full all the time. I would love for it to be another 10 years (or more) until I eat here again....glad I wasn't paying for it!"
0,Huge Disappointment - $20 per day for a resort fee that does not offer much is a bit of a sham.   \nWe stayed in one of the ue  rooms and I would agree with others about the shower being terrible and the room having a musty smell.   You can see that the vents have not been cleaned out in quite some time.  \nThe worst part is that we could not get any sleep until after 2 am due to the music ( or I should say the same beat repeating over and over) from the Voodoo lounge filling our room and shaking our walls.  \nWe called the front desk to change rooms and were told that no rooms were available.  The manager was supposed to call us which never happened. When we checked out the hotel thought that removing the resort fee was good enough.  After explaining that we had paid for a room that we were supposed to get some sleep in which did not happen the front desk was willing to remove an additional $20.  Wow - hold me back.  Needless to say we are not coming back.\nFYI  - stay off floor 35 of the masquerade tower.
0,"Bought an item from there, didn't notice it was an open item until i checked out. Took it back 5 days later because one of the buttons didn't work, and they refuse to take it back claiming i dropped and damaged it. I never dropped it, i brought it back to them in the same condition they sold it to me as.  Then the manager told me we would not have sold one in the condition. But they sure sold it to me. BUYER BEWARE."
1,"Service is excellent, food was very.good. I got general tso's, was crispy and not fatty like at some places. Rice was perfectly sticky, just how i like it. My friend had a stir fry of chicken, beef, and shrimp with vegetables, said it was very good. I also got the milky coconut puffs because of someone else's review...not a fan. Very strange gelled coconut center, batter dipped and fried, then topped with a sugar-peanut crumb mixture and honey. \n\nThe prices were reasonable, portions were big (i have lunch for tomorrow too).  I will definitely be going back!"
0,"Everything served in or on styrofoam, tasteless, overpriced.  My refrigerator has a bad smell in it from the leftovers:-("
1,"As big fans of Bobby Flay, Mesa Grill has been on our food bucket list forever. And his food did not disappoint!\n\nMargaritas - I can understand why Mesa Grill is famous for these. We tried the classic margarita and the cactus pear margarita. The classic was delicious with a good balance of flavors. The cactus pear was sweeter and while it started well, I was over the sweetness by the end.\n\nBlue Corn Lobster Tacos - talk about a flavor explosion... these were amazing! Definitely try these.\n\nGrilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops - tender, succulent lamb chops that were grilled to perfection. The mint chimichurri sauce was delicious. It came with a plantain tamale which sounded better than it tasted (again, my aversion to things too sweet).\n\n22oz Bone-in Rib-eye - big, bold, yummy...\n\nRoasted Brussels Sprouts - I know, I know, it's just brussels sprouts. But you haven't had these brussels sprouts. You must get these.\n\nFor dessert we had the Churros dusted with cinnamon sugar and star anise. The star anise was subtle and gave the churros an interesting scent and flavor. It was served with a dark chocolate and a coconut dulce de leche dipping sauce, the latter of which we could have licked out of the bowl. A great way to end the night.\n\nAs for dinner service, it left a little to be desired. Technically everything was executed fine. It's the little details like, the tables that flanked us were seated after us and offered dark napkins due to the customer's dark clothing. My husband and I were also in dark clothing but were not offered dark napkins, so I fussed with white lint on my black shirt the rest of the evening. And the server was effusive in his recommendations and menu explanations to both tables flanking us but didn't offer anything to us. It was weird and an example of how much better everything could have been.\n\nMotivated by the exceptional food, we came back for brunch and had the spicy scrambled eggs - perfect balance of spice, creaminess, sweet, salty, tangy. The service was great this time and it was an awesome way to start the day."
0,"Stay away from this place. This place is trash. The dentist doesn't know what she is doing at all. It seem like she is just graduated and has no experiences whatsoever. I had such a bad experience with this place from the beggining to the finish. I just had my root carnal a month ago. I was in so much pain during the whole process. It took 3 hours to finish the whole thing. I knew my teeth was that bad and it was just a root carnal. One day after the process, I was in so much pain that I had to take pain releive pill. I couldn't chew or even drink cold water. A few days later, my tooth had a small hole. So I had to go back to and get it fixed. I have never had this bad experience with a dentist like this before. I should've have stayed with my old dentist who has a lot more experiences. More than that the dentist is a bitch. She just wants your money. This place is hell. Stay away from it."
1,"I used to visit AJ's only for the sweets (Joseph Schmidt's truffles, gourmet chocolates, cheesecakes/bombes, Napoleons, cannolis, gourmet cookies) and the cheese department.  Noticed Philippines' San Miguel beers available here, too (at least they were last year).  Laloo's goatmilk ice cream used to be sold here, but today's visit yielded none in the aisles.  I've always wanted to try their hot foods, but it was only tonight's dinner that appealed to me- salmon with stuffed crab w/ a white cheese cream sauce.  Sides were an awesome scalloped potatoes w/ bacon and cream sauce and very dry-looking \""honey- glazed\"" carrots.  Thinking I'd have dinner elsewhere, I asked only to sample the potatoes, and they were so delicious!  Next time, plans be da*ned, if AJ's serving anything crab-stuffed and those scalloped potatoes, I'm definitely going to dine there!\n\nOther than for the specialty-food counters, you won't catch me shopping here... too expensive!  Better to shop at Whole Foods... Products are less-expensive, many are organic, and you won't find anything with trans-fats!"
0,"I'm still relieved to see that the mechanical bull is gone, but other than that, it looks like things have gone swiftly downhill since the first time came around. \n\nFood? Unspectacular. \nDrinks? Ordinary. \nService? Unrefined. \n\nIf I'm looking for an adult beverage in Town Square, I'm likely to go elsewhere.\nIf I'm looking for an Irish bar, I'm definitely going elsewhere."
1,The variety of flavors is astounding...how do they come up with this stuff?  I haven't had anything bad and the place is adorable...nice if you want a cool after dinner dessert out on the town.
1,"About $8 a sandwich.  A little out of the way.  The philly cheese steak was good.  As always, I threw in peppers.  Yum."
0,"This was the first and last time I will visit this sunny establishment. Please let me start by saying don't be fooled by the name thinking you may get some spice in your meal when visiting this establishment. I would like to enlighten any potential consumers on the epic failure of the evening I just experienced. Failure number one, they had our reservation incorrect and multiple times mentioning that we had made the reservation incorrectly. Failure number two, your menu on-line does not match your actual menu. When you say you have Hatch green chili on the menu make sure you can actually serve it. Multiple times I asked about the spice and was told it was very spicy, and was disappointed at the lack there of. I am a lover of New Mexico green chili, so if you compare your food to it you shouldn't be light years off on the descriptions.\n\nThird failure of the night was dumping a full ice cold drink down the side of my leg and back of my pants. Not only was I upset at the fact you soaked my jeans, but then offended at the idea the server was going to get a blow dryer and dry off my pants. If I wanted to wear my jeans straight out of the washing machine, I would have done so but thank you to the service staff, they took liberty of doing that for me. So, you want me to take off my pants to blow dry them you say, failure number four. \n\nEpic failure number five was the sub-par meals that followed along with the \""flaming\"" drink that is not worth ordering The food was by far the worst thing of the night, which compared to everything else would seem like nothing. If you think you are going to get food, turn around and go back home and eat a bean burrito.  \n\nAfter all that we attempted to salvage the evening with some humor, but then comes failure number six. When the bill arrives we were told that although the server dumped a drink all over me, nothing could be done to adjust the bill. It was just a little liquid as I was reminded by the server AND the manager. I wasn't looking to make a scene but when I stood up from the table, someone asked me if I had an \""accident\"" (I'm 29 and housebroken). Even to this point, I was just annoyed. \n\nThis brings us to failure number 7, when paying for the bill we presented our overly intelligent server a $50 visa card and asked her to run the card for that amount, and came back letting us know it was declined. In surprise, I look up the account information on my phone to only see of the $50 loaded on the card the previous day a $48 charge was in the transaction history for Fire and Spice. When we asked the server, she responded by asking if we had ever stayed in a hotel before and how there is an \""incidental\"" charge which is why the card didn't go through. I asked for the manager at this point, who felt it was okay to tell me again that the bill was now being discounted because of the small spill on me. So after showing him the charge on-line he then got his second level manager. \n\nOh boy, if you are in the mood for being told you are an idiot, this is the guy to talk to! Failure number 8. When you walk into a customer service situation as the second level manager in an issue, normally one would look to diffuse the situation and not escalate it. Not this guy, he enjoys full confrontation with customers. Not to mention he also witnessed the events of the night unfold and rather than offering to make the situation better, he chose the much higher route of saying that clearly our card was declined because there wasn't enough money on it even after seeing the transaction history of the card, with their establishment as the only charge. Nothing he said made sense and walked away as if we bothered him by asking for an explanation of the charge. \n\nSo here's to you manager's of Fire and Spice at the Sheraton Hotel in Tempe, AZ.. keeping it classy and bringing in customers to make them feel warm a fuzzy inside. Beware hospitality is at it's finest in this establishment!  WINNING!!!!"
0,If it was not for the price I probably would consider giving it three stars... 1) wine here is overpriced ALOT 2) we ordered bone-in rib eye as median but got almost well-done 3) lamb was tasteless 4) service was mediocre. Overall I had a really hard time giving more than 2 stars for a restaurant that's supposed to be such high-end but has no idea how to cook steak median...
1,"this place is so wonderful! warm bread always, good food, service is amazing. I always have to come here first when I get to Vegas. Wish they had one in the Bay Area. I se people compare it to Cheescake Factory but this is way better but yet somewhat similar. Located in The Venetian Hotel."
1,Love this place food is delicious
1,"By far one of my favorite overall dining experiences in Vegas. The food is executed with care, the staff is wArm and inviting. The wine list is solid, and the vibe of this small spot, has enough nostalgia, and swankyness to take make you feel like you truly are in a hidden gem that few know about. Don't be a moron and not try this place it's one of the best around"
1,I'm embarrassed that I have only ate here two times and I live in very close proximity of this restaurant. Ate here tonight and it was perfection.  The server was so genuine & amazing! Lettuce wraps were delish along with the inside out quinoa burger. I was so impressed with start to finish. This is on my new rotating list of places to eat.
1,"This is my favorite spot in Vegas to stop for breakfast.  I'm the kind of guy who likes breakfast food at all times of the day.  Their skillets here are amazing, and so are their pancakes!  Highly recommend!"
1,"Came here last night. I was looking for a a place to dance some Spanish music, and this place didn't disappoint. It was mostly couples it seemed like. The dance floor was a little small, but it was sufficient for our needs. \n\nWe got here at about 1:30 per another review and we even got in free!  Drink prices were what i expected, and the music had a good variety."
